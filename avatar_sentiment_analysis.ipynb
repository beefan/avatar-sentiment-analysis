My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads.

A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.

[He wedges himself free from underneath the weight of the snow and stalks off.]\"], ['Aang', \"[Surprised and with admiration.] You're a waterbender?\"], ['Katara', '[Nervously.] Well, sort of. Not yet.'], ['Kanna', 'All right, no more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores.'], ['Katara', \"[Excitedly.] I told you, he's the real thing Gran-Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me!\"], ['Kanna', '[Calmly.] Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.'], ['Katara', \"But he's special! I can tell! [Clenches her fist and closes her eyes in hope.] I sense he's filled with much wisdom.\"], ['Aang', '[Muffled.] See? Now my tongue is stuck to my staff!'], ['Iroh', '[Sternly.] Again.'], ['Iroh', '[Sighs while he gets up.] No! [Zuko lowers his arms and looks at his uncle.] Power in firebending comes from the breath [Iroh moves his both hand up in front of him to emphasize the breathing motion.], not the muscles. [He stretches his left arm out as if he was sending a fire blast.] The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire! [Iroh directs a fire blast at his nephew that evaporates just before it would scorch him.] Get it right this time.'], ['Zuko', \"[With suppressed anger, he walks toward his uncle and addresses him.] Enough! I've been drilling this sequence all day. Teach me the next set! I'm more than ready!\"], ['Iroh', 'No, you are impatient. [He sits down again on his chair.] You have yet to master your basics. [He yells his order.] Drill it again!'], ['Zuko', \"[The suppressed anger is very apparent in his voice.] The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender. [Close-up of Iroh, who does not look pleased with the attitude of his nephew.] He must be over a hundred years old by now. He's had a century to master the four elements! I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him. [Starts to yell at his uncle.] You will teach me the advanced set!\"], ['Iroh', '[Concedes reluctantly. On a dire tone.] Very well, [His expression changes completely to one of delight as he picks something up from the ground.] but first, I must finish my roast duck. [He quickly munches down the roast duck, much to the dismay of Zuko.]'], ['Sokka', '[With a stern expression.] Now men, it\\'s important that you show no fear when you face a firebender. [He brings out his club and holds it proudly.] In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing! For without courage, how can we call ourselves men? [He clutches his fist to emphasize the word \"men\" as he stares down the people in front of him.]'], ['Southern Water Tribe boy', '[Waving his hand in the air.] I gotta pee!'], ['Sokka', \"[Angrily.] Listen! Until your fathers return from the War, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe, and that means no potty breaks! [He makes some wide arm gestures to emphasize his words again.]\"], ['Southern Water Tribe boy', 'But I really gotta go!'], ['Sokka', '[Sighs.] Okay, who else has to go?'], ['Katara', '[Runs up to Sokka as the children leave. In a worried tone.] Have you seen Aang? Gran-Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.'], ['Aang', '[Amused.] Wow! Everything freezes in there!'], ['Sokka', '[Annoyed.] Uh! [Angrily points at Aang.] Katara, get him out of here! This lesson is for warriors only!'], ['Village boy', 'Whee!'], ['Sokka', \"[Yelling angrily.] Stop! Stop it right now! [The laughter of the children is stifled immediately and Appa turns his head to look at Sokka, who accusingly directs his anger to Aang.] What's wrong with you?! We don't have time for fun and games with the War going on!\"], ['Aang', \"[Slides down from Appa's head.] What war? What are you talking about?\"], ['Sokka', \"[Raises one eyebrow in disbelief.] You're kidding, right?\"], ['Aang', '[Exclaims enthusiastically.] Penguin!'], ['Sokka', \"He's kidding, right?\"], ['Katara', 'Aang?'], ['Aang', '[Chasing the penguins while laughing.] Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding? [He jumps at a penguin, but the animal evades his attempt and Aang belly flops into the snow. He turns on his back and quickly erects himself with his airbending as Katara comes up beside him.] Heh heh. I have a way with animals.'], ['Katara', \"[Amused.] Hehehe, Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.\"], ['Aang', \"[Having grabbed the tail of a penguin, he holds on as it pulls him through the snow for a short way before letting go and looking up at Katara.] You got a deal! Just one little problem ... [He airbends himself into a sitting position.] I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?\"], ['Katara', \"[Sadly.] No. You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole.\"], ['Aang', \"This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water. [He thinks for a moment.] What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.\"], ['Katara', 'Maybe, but we haven\\'t had contact with our sister tribe in a long time. It\\'s not exactly \"turn right at the second glacier\". It\\'s on the other side of the world.'], ['Aang', \"But you forget, I have a flying bison. [He happily points at himself.] Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole. Katara, we're going to find you a master!\"], ['Katara', \"[Unsure.] That's ... I mean, I don't know. I've never left home before.\"], ['Aang', 'Well, you think about it, but in the meantime, can you teach me catch one of these penguins?'], ['Katara', '[Mockingly imitating a teacher.] Okay, listen closely my young pupil. [Inclines her head toward Aang.] Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. [She conjures a fish out of her sleeve.] Observe!'], ['Aang', 'Hi hi hi! Ha, ha, ha!'], ['Katara', \"[Happily.] I haven't done this since I was a kid!\"], ['Aang', 'You still are a kid!'], ['Aang', '[In awe.] Whoa! What is that?'], ['Katara', \"[On a slightly dark tone.] A Fire Navy ship. And a very bad memory for my people. [Aang begins to approach the wreckage.] Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it! The ship could be booby-trapped!\"], ['Aang', 'If you want to be a bender, you have to let go of fear.'], ['Katara', \"[Her voice echoes through the room.] This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran-Gran was a little girl. [The camera shifts through the room, revealing all the weapons more closely.] It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.\"], ['Aang', \"Okay, back up. I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. [Aang picks up a Guan Dao to inspect it.] I've never seen any war.\"], ['Katara', 'Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?'], ['Aang', \"[Uncertain.] I don't know. A few days, maybe?\"], ['Katara', 'I think it was more like a hundred years!'], ['Aang', \"[In full disbelief and slightly accusing.] What?! That's impossible! Do I look like a hundred-twelve-year-old man to you?\"], ['Katara', \"Think about it. The War is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there the whole time! [Aang's expression changes to one of comprehension.] It's the only explanation.\"], ['Aang', \"A hundred years! [Saddened by his new discovery.] I can't believe it.\"], ['Katara', \"[Squats beside him.] I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this ...\"], ['Aang', '[Cheerfully.] I did get to meet you.'], ['Katara', \"[Smiling warmly at him while offering her hand.] Come on, let's get out of here.\"], ['Katara', \"Aang, let's head back, this place is creepy.\"], ['Aang', 'Huh?'], ['Aang', \"What's that you said about booby traps?\"], ['Aang', 'Uh oh ... [Aang notices a hole in the roof of the ship and takes a surprised Katara into his arms.] Hold on tight!'], ['Katara', 'Aaah!'], ['Zuko', 'The last airbender! [Aang and Katara reach the ground again and Aang sets Katara down. They start to walk away.] Quite agile for his old age. [He turns and angrily yells to a soldier behind him.] Wake my uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar. [Zuko peeks through his telescope again to see that Katara and Aang are running now. Zuko follows the direction they are running in with his telescope and discovers that they must be headed for the village he spots.] As well as his hiding place ...']]\n"
