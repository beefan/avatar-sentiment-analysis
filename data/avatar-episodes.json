{"episodes": [{"title": "The Boy in the Iceberg", "lines": [["Katara", "Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world."], ["Sokka", "It's not getting away from me this time. [Close-up of the boy as he grins confidently over his shoulder in the direction of the girl.] Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish."], ["Katara", "[Happily surprised.] Sokka, look!"], ["Sokka", "[Close-up of Sokka; whispering.] Sshh! Katara, you're going to scare it away. [A look of bliss adorns his face. He licks his lips and wiggles his fingers, not taking his eyes off the fish.] Mmmm ... I can already smell it cookin'."], ["Katara", "[Struggling with the water that passes right in front of her.] But, Sokka! I caught one!"], ["Katara", "[Exclaims indignantly.] Hey!"], ["Sokka", "Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?"], ["Katara", "[Cut to her face; she sighs lightly before answering in slight annoyance.] It's not \"magic\", it's waterbending! And it's ..."], ["Sokka", "Yeah, yeah, \"an ancient art unique to our culture\", blah, blah, blah. Look, I'm just saying [Grabbing his warrior's wolf knot with his left hand as he turns away from her, wringing the water out of it. Meanwhile, Katara has crossed her arms.] that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself."], ["Katara", "[Cut to her face as she raises an eyebrow skeptically, arms still crossed.] You're calling me weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water!"], ["Katara", "Watch out! Go left! Go left!"], ["Katara", "[A touch of bitterness in her voice.] You call that left?"], ["Sokka", "You don't like my steering? Well, maybe you should've [He waves his hands, mockingly imitating waterbending.] waterbended us out of the ice."], ["Katara", "[Indignantly.] So it's my fault?"], ["Sokka", "[Annoyed.] I knew I should've left you home! [Cut to a close-up of the siblings; Katara is staring down at her brother in anger while he rants calmly.] Leave it to a girl to screw things up!"], ["Katara", "You are the most sexist, [She brings her hands up to her head and swings them back down and behind her in her rage; the movement creates a small wave of water behind her.] immature, [Hands raised back to her head.] nut brained ... [Swings her arms back down again, creating a slightly larger wave; she raises her hands back to her head during a brief loss for words.] I'm embarrassed [Throwing a hand upward, a short jet of water shoots upward as well.] to be related to you!"], ["Katara", "Ever since mom died, [Points to herself.] I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier!"], ["Sokka", "[Pointing to the iceberg behind her, his voice subdued by fright.] Uh ... Katara ..."], ["Katara", "[Close-up of a rage-fueled Katara as she continues her outburst, a finger pointed in Sokka's face.] I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, not pleasant!"], ["Sokka", "[In a screeching voice, his eyes open wide in fear.] Katara, settle down!"], ["Katara", "No that's it! I'm done helping you! From now on, you're on your own!"], ["Sokka", "Okay, you've gone from \"weird\" to \"freakish\", [He releases her.] Katara."], ["Katara", "[Astonished.] You mean I did that?"], ["Sokka", "[Sarcastically, glancing at her and smirking.] Yep. [Nudging her with his elbow.] Congratulations."], ["Katara", "He's alive! We have to help!"], ["Sokka", "Katara, get back here! [He grabs his spear from the ice and runs after Katara, who is already at the ice's edge.] We don't know what that thing is!"], ["Zuko", "Finally! [He turns around to face another person in uniform, who sits at a small table.] Uncle, do you realize what this means?!"], ["Iroh", "[The man is playing some sort of card game. He answers calmly while looking over the tile he's holding toward his nephew.] I won't get to finish my game?"], ["Zuko", "[Turning around again to face the light.] It means my search is about to come to an end."], ["Zuko", "[Gestures at the light while facing his uncle again.] That light came from an incredibly powerful source! [The light dwindles and disappears.] It has to be him!"], ["Iroh", "[With continuing disinterest and an air of skepticism.] Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. [He looks at the tile in his hand, depicting the symbol of airbending.] I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. [He places it on a tile carrying the symbol of firebending and gestures toward the open place at the other side of the table while continuing in a relaxed voice.] Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?"], ["Zuko", "[Furiously, still facing Iroh.] I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar! Helmsman, head a course for the light!"], ["Sokka", "[Brandishing his spear in defense once again.] Stop!"], ["Katara", "[Waves the spear away. Annoyed.] Stop it!"], ["Aang", "[In a weak voice.] I need to ask you something ..."], ["Katara", "What?"], ["Aang", "Please ... come closer."], ["Katara", "[Curiously.] What is it?"], ["Aang", "[In a clear, happy, hopeful tone.] Will you go penguin sledding with me?"], ["Katara", "[Awkwardly.] Uh, sure ... I-I guess."], ["Aang", "[Looking around and rubbing his head, while Katara scrambles on her feet.] What's going on here?"], ["Sokka", "[Aggressively.] You tell us! [Points at the top of the crater.] How did you get in the ice? And why aren't you frozen? [He pokes the boy in his side with his spear.]"], ["Aang", "[Lazily pushes the spear away.] I'm ... not sure."], ["Aang", "[Exclaims happily.] Appa! Are you all right? [He hangs down the side of the beast to look at its eyes, which are still closed.] Wake up, buddy."], ["Aang", "[Laughing cheerfully.] Ha, ha! You're okay!"], ["Sokka", "What is that thing?"], ["Aang", "This is Appa, my flying bison."], ["Sokka", "[Sarcastically.] Right, and this is Katara, my flying sister. [Katara shoots him an odd look.]"], ["Aang", "[Cheerfully.] Don't worry, it'll wash out. [Green slime is hanging from Sokka's face to his glove, dripping down as he retracts his hand. Katara covers her mouth in disgust.] So do you guys live around here?"], ["Sokka", "[Pointing his spear accusingly again at Aang who is surprised to see the thing.] Don't answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light?! He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy!"], ["Katara", "[Pushes Sokka's spear away again and addresses him sarcastically.] Oh yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by that evil look in his eye. [Aang shoots the two an earnest grin.] The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name."], ["Aang", "I'm A ... a-a-a-Achoo! [The boy sneezes, creating an air blast that sends him soaring into the air. He lands on the ground, unharmed.] I'm Aang. [He sniffles a bit.]"], ["Sokka", "[Total disbelief.] You just sneezed ... [Points to the sky.] and flew ten feet in the air!"], ["Aang", "[He looks questioningly toward the sky.] Really? It felt higher than that."], ["Katara", "[Gasps for air in comprehension.] You're an airbender!"], ["Aang", "Sure am!"], ["Sokka", "Giant light beams, flying bison, airbenders ... [Walks away.] I think I got midnight sun madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense. [He realizes, however, that he is stranded in the middle of the ocean with no way home.]"], ["Aang", "Well, if you guys are stuck, Appa and I can give you a lift. [Aang airbends himself onto Appa.]"], ["Katara", "We'd love a ride! Thanks! [Katara runs to the side of the bison.]"], ["Sokka", "Oh no! I'm not getting on that fluffy snot monster!"], ["Katara", "[While climbing on top of Appa with the help of Aang.] Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know, before you freeze to death?"], ["Aang", "Okay, first time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip-yip!"], ["Aang", "Come on, Appa. Yip-yip!"], ["Sokka", "[Sarcastically.] Wow, that was truly amazing ..."], ["Aang", "[Katara shoots her brother an angry glance.] Appa's just a little tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see. [Katara smiles at Aang, who returns this gesture. When she wants to move back, she realizes that he is still smiling at her.]"], ["Katara", "[Uncomfortably.] Why are you smiling at me like that?"], ["Aang", "Oh, I was smiling? [Surprised, Katara smiles back.]"], ["Iroh", "I'm going to bed now. [Yawns and stretches.] Yep, a man needs his rest. [After a short pause, he abandons his try at a veiled suggestion and delivers his request more clearly, his tone tired.] Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right, and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather and great-grandfather all tried and failed."], ["Zuko", "Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine does. This coward's hundred years in hiding are over."], ["Katara", "Hey."], ["Aang", "Hey. What'cha thinkin' about?"], ["Katara", "I guess I was wondering, your being an airbender and all, if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar?"], ["Aang", "Oh, no. I didn't know him. I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry. [He smiles weakly at Katara.]"], ["Katara", "Okay. Just curious. [She slants her eyes in disappointment for a second before smiling again at Aang.] Good night."], ["Aang", "Sleep tight."], ["Katara", "Aang? Aang! Wake up. [Aang shoots up, throwing the covers of his body and gasping for air. Katara perches beside him and stands up as she sees that Aang is awake.] It's okay, we're in the village now! Come on, get ready. [She points to the door of the tent.] Everyone's waiting to meet you."], ["Katara", "Aang, this is the entire village. [Points to the line of villagers in front of them.] Entire village, Aang."], ["Aang", "[Uncomfortably.] Uh, why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on me?"], ["Kanna", "Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years. We thought they were extinct, until my granddaughter and grandson found you."], ["Aang", "[Shocked disbelief.] Extinct?"], ["Katara", "[Gesturing.] Aang, this is my grandmother."], ["Kanna", "Call me Gran-Gran."], ["Sokka", "[Annoyed.] What is this, a weapon? You can't stab anything with this!"], ["Aang", "[Aang uses a small air current to get his staff back.] It's not for stabbing! It's for airbending. [He opens his staff into a glider, making Sokka gasp in fright and cover his head with his hands.]"], ["Village girl", "[Excited.] Magic trick! Do it again!"], ["Aang", "Not magic, airbending. [He moves his glider around him, visually demonstrating what he is talking about.] It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly."], ["Sokka", "[Mockingly states his disbelief.] Ya know, last time I checked, humans can't fly!"], ["Aang", "[Accepting Sokka's challenge, smiling.] Check again!"], ["Village girl", "[In admiration.] He's flying!"], ["Village girl", "It's amazing!"], ["Sokka", "[Shocked.] My watchtower!"], ["Katara", "[Offering her hand to pull him out of the snow.] That was amazing!"], ["Sokka", "[Annoyed.] Great. You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender. Together you can just waste time all day long. [He wedges himself free from underneath the weight of the snow and stalks off.]"], ["Aang", "[Surprised and with admiration.] You're a waterbender?"], ["Katara", "[Nervously.] Well, sort of. Not yet."], ["Kanna", "All right, no more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores."], ["Katara", "[Excitedly.] I told you, he's the real thing Gran-Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me!"], ["Kanna", "[Calmly.] Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy."], ["Katara", "But he's special! I can tell! [Clenches her fist and closes her eyes in hope.] I sense he's filled with much wisdom."], ["Aang", "[Muffled.] See? Now my tongue is stuck to my staff!"], ["Iroh", "[Sternly.] Again."], ["Iroh", "[Sighs while he gets up.] No! [Zuko lowers his arms and looks at his uncle.] Power in firebending comes from the breath [Iroh moves his both hand up in front of him to emphasize the breathing motion.], not the muscles. [He stretches his left arm out as if he was sending a fire blast.] The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire! [Iroh directs a fire blast at his nephew that evaporates just before it would scorch him.] Get it right this time."], ["Zuko", "[With suppressed anger, he walks toward his uncle and addresses him.] Enough! I've been drilling this sequence all day. Teach me the next set! I'm more than ready!"], ["Iroh", "No, you are impatient. [He sits down again on his chair.] You have yet to master your basics. [He yells his order.] Drill it again!"], ["Zuko", "[The suppressed anger is very apparent in his voice.] The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender. [Close-up of Iroh, who does not look pleased with the attitude of his nephew.] He must be over a hundred years old by now. He's had a century to master the four elements! I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him. [Starts to yell at his uncle.] You will teach me the advanced set!"], ["Iroh", "[Concedes reluctantly. On a dire tone.] Very well, [His expression changes completely to one of delight as he picks something up from the ground.] but first, I must finish my roast duck. [He quickly munches down the roast duck, much to the dismay of Zuko.]"], ["Sokka", "[With a stern expression.] Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender. [He brings out his club and holds it proudly.] In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing! For without courage, how can we call ourselves men? [He clutches his fist to emphasize the word \"men\" as he stares down the people in front of him.]"], ["Southern Water Tribe boy", "[Waving his hand in the air.] I gotta pee!"], ["Sokka", "[Angrily.] Listen! Until your fathers return from the War, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe, and that means no potty breaks! [He makes some wide arm gestures to emphasize his words again.]"], ["Southern Water Tribe boy", "But I really gotta go!"], ["Sokka", "[Sighs.] Okay, who else has to go?"], ["Katara", "[Runs up to Sokka as the children leave. In a worried tone.] Have you seen Aang? Gran-Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago."], ["Aang", "[Amused.] Wow! Everything freezes in there!"], ["Sokka", "[Annoyed.] Uh! [Angrily points at Aang.] Katara, get him out of here! This lesson is for warriors only!"], ["Village boy", "Whee!"], ["Sokka", "[Yelling angrily.] Stop! Stop it right now! [The laughter of the children is stifled immediately and Appa turns his head to look at Sokka, who accusingly directs his anger to Aang.] What's wrong with you?! We don't have time for fun and games with the War going on!"], ["Aang", "[Slides down from Appa's head.] What war? What are you talking about?"], ["Sokka", "[Raises one eyebrow in disbelief.] You're kidding, right?"], ["Aang", "[Exclaims enthusiastically.] Penguin!"], ["Sokka", "He's kidding, right?"], ["Katara", "Aang?"], ["Aang", "[Chasing the penguins while laughing.] Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding? [He jumps at a penguin, but the animal evades his attempt and Aang belly flops into the snow. He turns on his back and quickly erects himself with his airbending as Katara comes up beside him.] Heh heh. I have a way with animals."], ["Katara", "[Amused.] Hehehe, Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending."], ["Aang", "[Having grabbed the tail of a penguin, he holds on as it pulls him through the snow for a short way before letting go and looking up at Katara.] You got a deal! Just one little problem ... [He airbends himself into a sitting position.] I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?"], ["Katara", "[Sadly.] No. You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole."], ["Aang", "This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water. [He thinks for a moment.] What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you."], ["Katara", "Maybe, but we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time. It's not exactly \"turn right at the second glacier\". It's on the other side of the world."], ["Aang", "But you forget, I have a flying bison. [He happily points at himself.] Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole. Katara, we're going to find you a master!"], ["Katara", "[Unsure.] That's ... I mean, I don't know. I've never left home before."], ["Aang", "Well, you think about it, but in the meantime, can you teach me catch one of these penguins?"], ["Katara", "[Mockingly imitating a teacher.] Okay, listen closely my young pupil. [Inclines her head toward Aang.] Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. [She conjures a fish out of her sleeve.] Observe!"], ["Aang", "Hi hi hi! Ha, ha, ha!"], ["Katara", "[Happily.] I haven't done this since I was a kid!"], ["Aang", "You still are a kid!"], ["Aang", "[In awe.] Whoa! What is that?"], ["Katara", "[On a slightly dark tone.] A Fire Navy ship. And a very bad memory for my people. [Aang begins to approach the wreckage.] Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it! The ship could be booby-trapped!"], ["Aang", "If you want to be a bender, you have to let go of fear."], ["Katara", "[Her voice echoes through the room.] This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran-Gran was a little girl. [The camera shifts through the room, revealing all the weapons more closely.] It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks."], ["Aang", "Okay, back up. I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. [Aang picks up a Guan Dao to inspect it.] I've never seen any war."], ["Katara", "Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?"], ["Aang", "[Uncertain.] I don't know. A few days, maybe?"], ["Katara", "I think it was more like a hundred years!"], ["Aang", "[In full disbelief and slightly accusing.] What?! That's impossible! Do I look like a hundred-twelve-year-old man to you?"], ["Katara", "Think about it. The War is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there the whole time! [Aang's expression changes to one of comprehension.] It's the only explanation."], ["Aang", "A hundred years! [Saddened by his new discovery.] I can't believe it."], ["Katara", "[Squats beside him.] I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this ..."], ["Aang", "[Cheerfully.] I did get to meet you."], ["Katara", "[Smiling warmly at him while offering her hand.] Come on, let's get out of here."], ["Katara", "Aang, let's head back, this place is creepy."], ["Aang", "Huh?"], ["Aang", "What's that you said about booby traps?"], ["Aang", "Uh oh ... [Aang notices a hole in the roof of the ship and takes a surprised Katara into his arms.] Hold on tight!"], ["Katara", "Aaah!"], ["Zuko", "The last airbender! [Aang and Katara reach the ground again and Aang sets Katara down. They start to walk away.] Quite agile for his old age. [He turns and angrily yells to a soldier behind him.] Wake my uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar. [Zuko peeks through his telescope again to see that Katara and Aang are running now. Zuko follows the direction they are running in with his telescope and discovers that they must be headed for the village he spots.] As well as his hiding place ..."]]}, {"title": "The Avatar Returns", "lines": [["Katara", "Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world."], ["Village kids", "[Joyfully.] Yay! Aang's back!"], ["Sokka", "[Angrily.] I knew it! [Accusingly points a finger at Aang as he and Katara draw closer.] You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare! You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?"], ["Katara", "[Protesting.] Aang didn't do anything! It was an accident."], ["Aang", "[Sheepishly, as Katara glares at Sokka.] Yeah. We were on the ship and there was this booby trap, and, well -- [Awkwardly rubs his head.] -- we booby-ed right into it."], ["Kanna", "[Worriedly.] Katara, you shouldn't have gone on that ship! Now we could all be in danger!"], ["Aang", "[Sorrowfully.] Don't blame Katara. I brought her there. It's my fault."], ["Sokka", "[Angry and triumphant, having found an excuse.] Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy.

[Pointing to Aang.] I'm protecting you, from threats like him!"], ["Katara", "[Angrily.] Aang is not our enemy! [Continues in a calm, soothing voice.] Don't you see? Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time: fun."], ["Sokka", "[Annoyed.] Fun?! We can't fight firebenders with fun!"], ["Aang", "[Optimistically.] You should try it sometime."], ["Sokka", "[Angrily.] Get out of our village! Now!"], ["Katara", "[Pleading.] Grandmother, please. Don't let Sokka do this!"], ["Kanna", "[Gravely.] Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden. Sokka is right. I think it best if the airbender leaves."], ["Katara", "[Outraged.] Fine! Then I'm banished, too! [Drags Aang away.] Come on Aang, let's go."], ["Sokka", "[Demanding.] Where do you think you're going?"], ["Katara", "[Angrily.] To find a waterbender. Aang is taking me to the North Pole."], ["Aang", "[Confusedly.] I am? [Brightening.] Great!"], ["Sokka", "Katara! Would you really choose him over your tribe? [Shows shot of the entire Southern Water Tribe.] Your own family?"], ["Aang", "[Understanding.] Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family."], ["Katara", "[Upset.] So, you're leaving the South Pole?

Yip-yip!"], ["Sokka", "[Mockingly.] Yeah, I thought so!"], ["Southern Water Tribe girl", "[Runs from crowd to stand next to Katara with tears in her eyes.] Ahhh! [Close-up.] Aang, don't go! I'll miss you!"], ["Aang", "[Sadly.] I'll miss you, too.

[Angrily.] You're just a child!"], ["Aang", "[Calmly, tilting his head to one side with a somewhat confused expression.] Well, you're just a teenager."], ["Aang", "If I go with you, [He holds his staff in front of him as an offer, making sure Zuko understands that he does not wish to continue fighting.] will you promise to leave everyone alone?"], ["Katara", "[Sadly.] No! Aang, don't do this!"], ["Aang", "[Surprisingly calm.] Don't worry, Katara. It'll be okay. [He gasps when he is shoved on the walkway. Katara's face contorts with sadness and fright.] Take care of Appa for me until I get back."], ["Zuko", "[Boarding the ship up the walkway. Determined.] Head a course for the Fire Nation.

Kanna walks over to face Katara.] It's been so long since I've had hope, but you brought it back to life, my little waterbender. [Hugs Katara and who at the end takes the sleeping back out of her hands; to Sokka.] And you, my brave warrior, be nice to your sister."], ["Sokka", "[Kanna hugs Sokka, who, slightly embarrassed, pats her back.] Yeah, okay Gran.

[Inspects the staff further.] I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks. [To his soldiers.] Take the Avatar to the prison hold, [Handing the staff to Iroh.] and take this to my quarters."], ["Iroh", "[Turns to one of Zuko's men and gives him the staff; casually.] Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?"], ["Aang", "[Slyly.] So, I guess you've never fought an airbender before.

Girls are better at fixing pants than guys and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that.

[Shows that the pants are still ripped.] And look what a great job I did!"], ["Sokka", "[Protesting and pleading.] Wait! I was just kidding.

Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?"], ["Katara", "[Cut to close frontal view of Aang who is looking at something, his hand held against his brow. The siblings stand in the background.] He's right. At this rate, we won't get to the North Pole until spring."], ["Aang", "[Camera moves back to reveal Appa as well. Innocently.] But Appa's tired, aren't you boy?"], ["Aang", "[Nudges Appa against his front leg with his elbow.] I said, aren't you boy?"], ["Sokka", "[Aang smiles over his shoulder at the duo. Sarcastically.] Yeah, that was real convincing.[Somewhat fearfully.] Still, hard to argue with a ten-ton magical monster."], ["Aang", "[Runs toward the shore, takes a sharp breath and points. Excitedly.] Look!"], ["Aang", "[Excited.] That's why we're here. [Starts to disrobe while more koi fish jump out of the water in the background.] Elephant koi, and I'm gonna ride it.

Aaaah!"], ["Aang", "[Frightened.] Whaaaahh!"], ["Katara", "What was that thing?"], ["Aang", "I don't know."], ["Sokka", "[Stands up and wipes his hands together.] Well, let's not stick around to find out. Time to hit the road."], ["Sokka", "Or, we could stay a while."], ["Oyaji", "[Voice-over.] You three have some explaining to do."], ["Suki", "[Voice-over.] And if you don't answer all our questions, we're throwing you back in the water with Unagi."], ["Sokka", "[Close-up of the blindfolded Sokka. Challenging.] Show yourselves, cowards!"], ["Sokka", "[Aggressively.] Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us?"], ["Suki", "[Stepping forward, gesturing heavily with her clenched fist. Indignantly.] There were no men. We ambushed you. Now tell us, who are you and what are you doing here?"], ["Sokka", "[Closer side-view shot of Sokka who stares at them in disbelief.] Wait a second, [He amusingly glance to his right to where Aang stands as if he is looking for confirmation. Mockingly.] there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down."], ["Suki", "[Grabs Sokka by his collar. Angrily.] A bunch of girls, huh? Unagi is gonna eat well tonight."], ["Katara", "[Leans forward in her bonds. Pleading and apologetically.] No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes.

The camera pans the left to reveal a sorrowfully looking Aang.] I'm sorry we came here. I wanted to ride the elephant koi."], ["Oyaji", "[Cut to a frontal view of Oyaji. Angrily.] How do we know you're not [Points at the bound three.] Fire Nation spies? Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far. And we intend to keep it that way!"], ["Aang", "[Cut back to Aang, a brightened expression on his face.] This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!"], ["Oyaji", "[Humorless.] Ha! How could you possibly know her?"], ["Oyaji", "Avatar Kyoshi was born here four hundred years ago. [Close-up of the face of the statue. The colors have faded away a bit, but it is still clear that Kyoshi wears the same white face paint, with the red accentuated eyes as the modern Kyoshi Warriors wear.] She's been dead for centuries."], ["Aang", "[Cut to Aang who looks pensive at the statue before looking at the ground in front of him. He speaks in a soft, calm voice while the camera slowly zooms in on him.] I know her because I'm the Avatar."], ["Suki", "[Not convinced by Aang's statement. Shaking her fist to emphasize her words.] That's impossible! The last Avatar was an airbender who disappeared a hundred years ago."], ["Aang", "[Cut to Aang and his friend from a point of view between Suki and Oyaji. Aang smiles sheepishly.] That's me!"], ["Oyaji", "[Cut to frontal view of Suki and Oyaji who angrily points at Aang while looking at Suki.] Throw the impostor to Unagi!"], ["Katara", "[Nervously.] Aang ... do some airbending."], ["Spectators", "[Talking all at once.] Wow! Did you see that? Airbender!"], ["Oyaji", "[In awe.] It's true ... you are the Avatar!"], ["Aang", "[Cut to a frontal view of Aang with a serious look on his face, a relieved Sokka and Katara still tied up in the background to his left.] Now ... [He pulls his marbles out from underneath his robes.] check this out!"], ["Little girl", "[Excited.] Did you hear the news? [The fisherman picks up his basket.] The Avatar's on Kyoshi!"], ["Fisherman", "[Due to his utter surprise, he drops his basket.] Huh?"], ["Zuko", "[Yells on a demanding tone.] The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island?

He's not getting away from me this time."], ["Iroh", "[Casually points at the smoking fish in front of him.] Are you going to finish that?"], ["Zuko", "[Turns around and snatches the plate off the table. Aggressively.] I was going to save it for later!"], ["Aang", "[Throws his arms in the air while Momo digs in and chitters. Ecstatic.] All right! Dessert for breakfast!"], ["Aang", "These people sure know [The rest is kind of muffled out because he is cramming his desserts in his mouth.] how to treat an Avatar!"], ["Aang", "[Impressed.] Mmm ... [Offers one of the desserts he is holding to Katara.] Katara you've got to try these!"], ["Katara", "[Puts down the orange dessert, accepts the dessert Aang offers her and takes a bit.] Well, maybe just a bite."], ["Aang", "Sokka, what's your problem? Eat!"], ["Sokka", "Not hungry."], ["Aang", "[Aang leans backward to be able to look past Katara to Sokka; his eyes wide open in surprise.] But you're always hungry!"], ["Katara", "[Glancing amusingly at Aang. Slightly mocking.] He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday."], ["Sokka", "[Protesting.] They snuck up on me!"], ["Katara", "[Mockingly looks at her brother.] Right. And then they kicked your butt."], ["Sokka", "[Indignant.] Sneak attacks don't count! [Walks out of the scene with big strides. Mumbling to himself.] Tie me up with ropes! I'll show them a thing or two. [Comes back to the table to face Katara and Aang. Momo grabs some more pastries that lie around him.] I'm not scared of any girls. [Snatches some of the desert of the table.] Who do they think they are anyway? [He shoves one of the deserts in his mouth and stalks off again.] Mmm ... this is tasty."], ["Aang", "What's he so angry about? [Excited.] It's great here. They're giving us the royal treatment!"], ["Katara", "Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long."], ["Aang", "[Lowers his arm with the pastry and offers it to Momo's grasping paw.] I'm sure we'll be fine. [The lemur feels the desert and quickly snatches it out of Aang's hand.] Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town? [Aang moves closer to Katara and turns around to look out of the window at the statue.] They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!"], ["Katara", "Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar. [Slightly concerned.] I just hope it doesn't all go to your head."], ["Aang", "[Reassuring.] Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk."], ["Painter", "[Muttering to himself.] Hmmm ... Painting the Avatar ... that's easy enough ... [He lowers the canvas and notices that another girl has pulled up next to Aang. Surprised.] Oh, there's another one ... [He obscures his models again from sight by raising his canvas and painting the outlines of the other girl.] Well, I'll make an adjustment here, and ... [He lowers the canvas to see that three more girls have joined Aang.] There's more ... [He obscures the Avatar and his fangirls from sight again with his canvas while he quickly paints Aang.] well that ..."], ["Sokka", "[Angrily grunting to himself.] I can't believe I got beat up by a bunch of girls."], ["Sokka", "[Condescending.] Sorry ladies, [Suki and the other warriors stop their exercise and close their fans.

[Cut to a side-view while Sokka is loosening up his hips.] Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar."], ["Sokka", "[Stretching his arms.] It's all right. [Mockingly suppressing a laugh while speaking.] I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception."], ["Suki", "[Sarcastically.] I should hope so. A big strong man like you? We wouldn't stand a chance."], ["Sokka", "[Smugly.] True. But don't feel bad. After all, I'm the best warrior in my village."], ["Suki", "[Keeps using sarcasm without Sokka catching on to it. Leans slightly toward Sokka.] Wow! Best warrior, huh? [Glances back to the other Kyoshi Warriors.] In your whole village? [Looks back to Sokka.] Maybe you'd be kind enough to give us a little demonstration."], ["Sokka", "[Frontal view of Sokka as his eyes widen upon hearing the unexpected request.] Oh ... Well ... I mean ... I ..."], ["Suki", "[Turns to the other warriors.] Come on, girls! Wouldn't you like him to show us some moves?"], ["Sokka", "Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy to.

Now, this may be a little tough, but try to block me."], ["Sokka", "[Rubbing his hurt right shoulder. Impressed.] Aw! Heh heh ... Good. Of course, I was going easy on you."], ["Suki", "[Close-up of Suki's confident face.] Of course."], ["Sokka", "[He starts with a mumble, raising his tone of voice with each word.] Let's see if you can [Shouting while he attempts to hit Suki with a roundhouse kick.] handle this!"], ["Sokka", "[His voice cracking in anger.] That does it!"], ["Suki", "[Mockingly.] Anything else you want to teach us?"], ["Aang", "There she is, girls. Me in a past life."], ["Fangirls", "Ooohhh ..."], ["Koko", "[Admiringly.] You were pretty!"], ["Aang", "[Holding up a finger to draw their attention.] Excuse me for a second, ladies."], ["Katara", "[Turns around in surprise, but is happy to see that the poke came from Aang.] Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the room? [She moves the pot toward Aang.] It's a little heavy."], ["Aang", "[Holding up his hands to fob off with the offered pot.] Actually, I can't right now."], ["Katara", "[Slightly irritated.] What do you mean, \"you can't?\""], ["Aang", "I promised the girls I'd give them a ride on Appa. Why don't you come with us? It'll be fun!"], ["Katara", "[Resumed filling the pot with more vegetables.] Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does not sound like fun."], ["Aang", "[Disappointed.] Well, neither does carrying your basket."], ["Katara", "[Annoyed.] It's not my basket.

[Annoyed.] I thought you promised me that this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head."], ["Aang", "It didn't. You know what I think? You just don't want to come because you're jealous."], ["Katara", "[Close-up; angrily.] Jealous? [More high pitched voice.] Of what?"], ["Aang", "Jealous that we're having so much fun without you."], ["Katara", "[Irritated.] That's ridiculous."], ["Aang", "It is a little ridiculous, but I understand."], ["Katara", "[Turning away; irritated.] Urch!"], ["Sokka", "[Timidly.] Uh ... Hey, Suki."], ["Suki", "[Hostile.] Hoping for another dance lesson?"], ["Sokka", "[Cut to a shot of Sokka who does not know how to act.] No ...

[Sokka, Katara, and Aang gasp.] a feast!"], ["Bumi", "[To Aang.] The people in my city have gotten fat from too many feasts, [Leaning in over Aang, grabbing the chicken leg that is on his plate, holding it in front of him.] so I hope you like your chicken with no skin."], ["Aang", "Thanks, but I don't eat meat."], ["Bumi", "[To Sokka.] How about you? I bet you like meat."], ["Katara", "[Quietly to Aang.] Is it just me, or [Turns circles with her index finger beside her temple, implying the king is crazy.] is this guy's crown a little crooked?"], ["Bumi", "[Aerial shot of the dining table as Bumi pulls up to his seat.] So tell me, young bald one, [Sitting down.] where are you from?"], ["Aang", "[Close-up.] I'm from ... Kangaroo Island!"], ["Bumi", "[Cut to the King, two guards standing watch behind him.] Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh? I hear that place is really hopping!"], ["Sokka", "[Stops laughing; unsure.] What? It was pretty funny."], ["Bumi", "[Cut back to the king, who lazily stretches his arms, and yawns.] Well, all these good jokes are making me tired. Guess it's time to hit the hay."], ["Bumi", "[Gesturing at Aang.] There's an airbender in our presence, and not just any airbender. [Close-up as he decisively stands up.] The Avatar!"], ["Bumi", "[Sits down again.] Now, what do you have to say for yourself, [Close-up, smiling satisfied.] Mr. Pippinpaddleopsicopolis?"], ["Aang", "[Standing up, throwing his hands in the air.] Okay, you caught me. [Frontal shot of the three friends.] I'm the Avatar. Doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe. Everything checks out. [Aang looks underneath table.] No firebenders here. So, good work, everybody! [Pulling Katara and Sokka into a hug.] Love each other, [Cut to a dismayed looking king.] respect all life, [Cut to a shot of the threesome walking backward toward the exit.] and don't run with your spears. We'll see you next time!"], ["Katara", "[Accusingly.] You can't keep us here! Let us leave!"], ["Bumi", "Lettuce leaf?"], ["Sokka", "[Cut to the threesome. Sokka holds his hand for his mouth; whispering.] We're in serious trouble. This guy is nuts."], ["Bumi", "[Close-up.] Tomorrow, the Avatar will [Slowly zooming in close-up of Aang.] face three deadly challenges. [Back to Bumi.] But for now, the guards will show you to your chamber."], ["Chamberlain", "[Leaning in toward Bumi.] My liege, do you mean the good chamber or the bad chamber?"], ["Bumi", "[Turning to the guard.] The newly refurbished chamber."], ["Chamberlain", "[Putting finger in the air.] Wait, which one are we talking about?"], ["Bumi", "The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent refurbishing, that is. Of course, we've been calling it the new chamber, but we really should number them. [Switch to a frontal shot of the three children as they are being led out of the room, flanked by two guards. Commanding.] Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad!"], ["Katara", "This is a prison cell? But it's so nice."], ["Aang", "[Momo jumps off Aang's shoulders and onto a bed.] He did say it was newly refurbished."], ["Sokka", "Nice or not, we're prisoners!"], ["Aang", "[Close-up; worried.] I wonder what these challenges are gonna to be."], ["Katara", "[Determined.] We're not sticking around to find out. There's got to be some way out of here."], ["Aang", "[Excitedly pointing at something at the other side of the room.] The air vents!"], ["Sokka", "[Harshly.] If you think we're going to fit through there, you're crazier than that king."], ["Aang", "[Turning to Sokka.] We can't, but Momo can!"], ["Aang", "[Hopeful.] Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!"], ["Aang", "Go on, boy, get Appa!"], ["Sokka", "Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?"], ["Aang", "[Voice-over.] Appa's a ten-ton flying bison; I think he could figure something out."], ["Katara", "[Climbing into her bed.] Well, no point arguing about it now. Get some rest, Aang. [Aang walks toward his bed.] Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow."], ["Aang", "[Alarmed.] Sokka? [Switch to Aang's point of view; the other beds are empty.] Katara? [Frontal shot as Aang turns toward the guard.] Where are my friends?"], ["Guard", "[Frontal shot.] The king will free them if you complete your challenges."], ["Aang", "[Frontal shot; unsure.] And if I fail?"], ["Guard", "[Frontal shot.] He didn't say. [Extending his arm; switch back to a shot of the guard.] Your staff, please?"], ["Bumi", "[Serious.] First, Avatar, [Frontal shot as Bumi spread his arms, showing off his purple outfit; lighthearted.] what do you think of my new outfit? I want your honest opinion. [Frontal shot of Aang who blankly stares at the king. Someone coughs during the ensuing silence. Switch back to a frontal shot of Bumi.] I'm waiting."], ["Aang", "[Scratching his head.] I ... guess it's fine."], ["Bumi", "Excellent! You passed the first test."], ["Aang", "Really?"], ["Bumi", "[Upbeat.] Well, not one of the deadly tests. [Waving his finger from side to side, emphasizing his words.] The real challenges are much more, uh, challenging."], ["Aang", "[Aggressively.] I don't have time for your crazy games! [Close-up of King Bumi.] Give me my friends back! We're leaving!"], ["Bumi", "Oh, I thought you might refuse, [Side shot of the two. A wall opens, revealing Katara and Sokka struggling in the grasp of a guard. Aang turns to them.] so I will give your friends some special souvenirs."], ["Bumi", "[Voice-over.] Those delightful rings are made of pure jennamite, also known as creeping crystal. It's a crystal that grows remarkably fast. [Close-up of Bumi; sinister.] By nightfall your friends will be completely covered in it. [Slightly sympathetic.] Terrible thing, really. [Serious.] I can stop it, but only if you cooperate."], ["Sokka", "[Panicking.] Ah! It's already creeping!"], ["Aang", "[Cut back to a side shot of Aang and Bumi; serious.] I'll do what you want."], ["Bumi", "It seems I've lost my lunch box key and I'm hungry. Ooh, there it is! [Bumi points to inside the waterfall.] Would you mind fetching it for me?"], ["Bumi", "[Sarcastically.] Ooh, climbing the ladder. No one's ever done that before."], ["Bumi", "That's right. Keep diving head in. I'm sure it'll work eventually."], ["Aang", "There! Enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back now!"], ["Bumi", "Ah, not yet. I need help with another matter. It seems I've lost my pet, Flopsie."], ["Aang", "Okay! Found him!"], ["Bumi", "Bring him to me. Daddy wants a kiss from Flopsie!"], ["Aang", "Come here, Flopsie. [Flopsie jumps down behind Aang, startling both him and the bunny.] Huh?"], ["Aang", "Flopsie, wait! Flopsie! [Cut to Bumi laughing. Back to Aang chasing the bunny.] Flopsie!"], ["Aang", "Wait a minute. [Close-up of Flopsie snarling. Cut to behind Aang.] Flopsie?"], ["Aang", "Flopsie!"], ["Bumi", "[Rubbing Flopsie's belly.] Oh, that's a good boy. Yes, who has a soft belly?"], ["Aang", "[Aang jumps up to where Katara and Sokka. Both are encased in crystal to their shoulders.] Guys, are you okay?"], ["Katara", "Other than the crystals encasing my entire body, doing great!"], ["Bumi", "[Rubbing Flopsie's belly.] Oh, yes."], ["Aang", "Come on! I'm ready for the next challenge."], ["Bumi", "Your final test is a duel. And as a special treat, you may choose your opponent."], ["Bumi", "Point and choose."], ["Aang", "So ... you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight?"], ["Bumi", "Choose wisely!"], ["Aang", "I ... choose ... you. [Aang points to the king.]"], ["Bumi", "Wrong choice!"], ["Bumi", "You thought I was a frail old man, but I'm the most powerful earthbender you'll ever see."], ["Aang", "Can I fight the guy with the axe instead?"], ["Bumi", "There are no take-backsies in my kingdom. You might need this. [Points to the guard standing near Katara and Sokka.]"], ["Bumi", "Typical airbender tactic: avoid and evade. I hoped the Avatar would be less predictable."], ["Bumi", "Don't you have any surprises for me? Sooner or later you'll have to strike back!"], ["Bumi", "You'll have to be a little more creative than that!"], ["Bumi", "Did someone leave the windows open? It feels a little drafty in here. Are you hoping I'll catch a cold?"], ["Bumi", "How are you going to get me from way over there?"], ["Bumi", "Well done, Avatar. You fight with much fire in your heart. [He tosses the boulder aside and bends up to the balcony where the two siblings are almost completely encased. Aang joins him.] You've passed all my tests. Now, you must answer one question."], ["Aang", "That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests."], ["Bumi", "Oh, but what's the point of tests if you don't learn anything?"], ["Sokka", "Oh, come on!"], ["Bumi", "Answer this one question and I will set your friends free. What ... is my name? From the looks of your friends I'd say you only have a few minutes."], ["Aang", "How am I supposed to know his name?"], ["Katara", "Think about the challenges. Maybe it's some kind of riddle."], ["Sokka", "I got it!"], ["Aang", "Yeah?"], ["Sokka", "He's an earthbender, right? Rocky. You know, because of all the rocks."], ["Katara", "We're going to keep trying, but that is a good back-up."], ["Aang", "Okay. So back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall, I saved his pet, and I had a duel."], ["Katara", "And what did you learn?"], ["Aang", "Well, everything was different than I expected."], ["Katara", "[The jennamite grows as she talks with anxiety.] And?"], ["Aang", "Well, they weren't straight forward. To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would. I know his name."], ["Aang", "I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities. [The king laughs with the same odd snort Bumi did a hundred years ago.] Bumi, you're a mad genius."], ["Bumi", "Oh Aang, it's good to see you. You haven't changed a bit. Literally."], ["Katara", "Uh, over here!"], ["Sokka", "Little help?"], ["Bumi", "Jennamite is made of rock candy. [He takes a bite into the crystal.] Delicious!"], ["Katara", "So this crazy king is your old friend Bumi?"], ["Bumi", "Who are you calling old? Okay, I'm old."], ["Sokka", "Why did you do all of this instead of just telling Aang who you were?"], ["Bumi", "First of all, it's pretty fun messing with people. [Snorts.] But I do have a reason. Aang, you have a difficult task ahead. The world has changed in the hundred years that you've been gone. It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai. You have much to learn. You must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord. And when you do, I hope you will think like a mad genius. And it looks like you're in good hands. You'll need your friends to help defeat the Fire Nation. [Momo climbs up on Aang.] And you'll need Momo, too."], ["Aang", "Thank you for your wisdom, but before we leave, I have a challenge for you."], ["Cabbage merchant", "My cabbages!"]]}, {"title": "Imprisoned", "lines": [["Aang", "[Enthusiastically.] Great, you're back!"], ["Aang", "What's for dinner?"], ["Sokka", "[Digs nuts from his bag.] We've got a few options. First; round nuts. And some kind of oval shaped nuts? And some rock-shaped nuts, that might just be rocks. [Throws the rock-shaped nut toward Momo.] Dig in!

I'm Katara! What's your name?"], ["Aang", "[Sokka and Aang approach Katara; yelling.] Nice to meet you!"], ["Katara", "[Shrugging.] I just wanted to say hi."], ["Aang", "Hey! That guy's gotta be running somewhere. Maybe we're near a village? And I bet that village has a market!"], ["Katara", "[Excitedly.] Which means no nuts for dinner!"], ["Sokka", "[Katara and Aang chase after Haru.] Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts!

Speaks to herself in surprise.] Hey ..."], ["Haru", "Hi, Mom."], ["Haru's mother", "Where have you been, Haru? You're late! Get started on your chores."], ["Katara", "[Enters the shop's front door, startling Haru.] Hey. You're that kid. Why did you run away before?"], ["Haru", "Uh, you must have me confused with some other kid."], ["Aang", "[Aang and Sokka enter the shop.] No, she doesn't. We saw you earthbending."], ["Haru's mother", "[Standing by the window.] They saw you doing what?!"], ["Haru", "They're crazy, Mom! I mean, look at how they're dressed."], ["Haru's mother", "You know how dangerous that is! You know what would happen if they caught you earthbending!"], ["Tax collector", "[Heavy knocks on the door.] Open up!"], ["Sokka", "[Sokka peeks through the window's blinds.] Fire Nation!

And everyone here's too much of a coward to do anything about it."], ["Haru's mother", "[Angered.] Quiet, Haru! Don't talk like that."], ["Katara", "[Curiously.] But, Haru's an earthbender? He can help!"], ["Haru's mother", "Earthbending is forbidden. It's caused nothing but misery for this village!

It's a part of who we are."], ["Haru's mother", "[Shakes head in dismay.] You don't understand."], ["Katara", "I understand that Haru can help you fight back.

But you should leave in the morning."], ["Aang", "Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay."], ["Katara", "I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father."], ["Haru", "That's okay. It's funny, the way you were talking back in the store? It reminded me of him."], ["Katara", "[Flattered.] Thanks."], ["Haru", "My father was very courageous. When the Fire Nation invaded, he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one. But they fought back anyway."], ["Katara", "He sounds like a great man."], ["Haru", "[Stops.] After the attack, they rounded up my father and every other earthbender, and took them away.

[Close-up, earthbends two stones in a circle above his hand.] the only way I can feel close to my father now [Crushes the stones to sand\u00a0with his hands.

The warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion. I'm sorry, but we're powerless."], ["Katara", "[Obstinately.] We'll see about that."], ["Katara", "Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child in my Water Tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders. [The watchman walks up to talk the warden, but the warden stops him and listens.] Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend. But they can't take away your courage. And it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home! It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now!

With an empty saddle."], ["Warden", "Which was it? A buffalo or a bison?"], ["Captain", "Uh, I'm not sure what the difference is, but that's not really the point, is it, sir?"], ["Warden", "[Furiously.] I'll decide what the point is, fool!"], ["Warden", "[To the second guard as he straightens up.] You!

I bet they're burning coal. In other words, earth."], ["Katara", "It's almost dawn. We're running out of time! You sure this is gonna work?"], ["Sokka", "It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village. We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale.

But he never came."], ["Aang", "[Looking down, guiltily.] They were waiting for me."], ["Sokka", "[Humorously mocking.] Hey don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late! [Aang scowls heavily at Sokka.]"], ["Shyu", "They lost hope the Avatar would ever return. When Fire Lord Sozin began the War, my grandfather and the other sages were forced to follow him. [Shakes head sadly.] I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming, I knew I would have to betray the other sages."], ["Aang", "Thank you for helping me. [Close-up as Shyu smiles to Aang.]"], ["Shyu", "[Continues leading the group up a spiraling flight of stairs.] We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary.

Only then will you be able to speak with him."], ["Shyu", "[Gasps.] No!"], ["Aang", "[Approaches door.] Shyu, what's wrong?"], ["Shyu", "The sanctuary doors, they're closed!"], ["Katara", "[Aang tugs at the door uselessly.] Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?"], ["Shyu", "No. Only a fully realized Avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone. Otherwise, the sages must open this door together, [Sokka shown in deep thought.] with five simultaneous fire blasts."], ["Sokka", "[Ponderously states.] Five fire blasts, huh? [Zoom out to show a lamplight above him.] I think I can help you out."], ["Zuko", "Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail, while I use it as a cover."], ["Sokka", "[Kneeling. Pours oil into a bag.] This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and, [Picks up bag, holds it proudly before him.] ta-da! Fake firebending!"], ["Katara", "[Impressed.] You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka."], ["Shyu", "This might actually work."], ["Shyu", "[Time skip. Sokka places his last bag into the dragon's mouth.] The sages will hear the explosion, so as soon as they go off, you rush in!"], ["Katara", "[Hides behind a column with her brother. Holds Momo. Glances to the next column where Aang hides.] It's almost sunset. Are you ready?"], ["Aang", "Definitely."], ["Aang", "[Surprised.] They're still locked!"], ["Shyu", "[Sadly sighs. Sokka rises from hiding behind his sister.] It didn't work. [Aang falls to his knees.]"], ["Aang", "[Time skip. Everyone stands in front of the door. Aang beats upon it furiously with consecutive airbending slices.] Why, won't, it, open?!"], ["Katara", "[Presses forward. Seizes Aang's arm.] Aang! Stop!

Runs his finger across the black soot.] I don't get it. That firebending looked as strong as any firebending I've seen."], ["Katara", "[A moment passes. Sudden excitement.] Sokka, you're a genius!"], ["Aang", "[Confused.] Wait. How is Sokka a genius? His plan didn't even work."], ["Sokka", "[Pleasantly.] Come on Aang. Let her dream."], ["Katara", "You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work. But it looks like it did."], ["Aang", "[Dubiously.] Did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years? [Katara grasps her chin, slyly grinning toward Aang.]"], ["Shyu", "[Time skip. Fire Sages run toward Shyu in front of the door.] Come quickly! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary!"], ["Great Fire Sage", "How did he get in?"], ["Shyu", "I don't know. But look at the scorch marks! And down there! [Points to a shadow visible at the bottom of the door.]"], ["Great Fire Sage", "He's inside! Open the doors, immediately! Before he contacts Avatar Roku!"], ["Great Fire Sage", "It's the Avatar's lemur. He must have crawled through the pipes! We've been tricked!"], ["Shyu", "[Grabs the last free sage and hauls him into his grip, pinning him.] Now, Aang!"], ["Katara", "[A moment of silence.] Aang! Now's your chance!"], ["Zuko", "[Steps out from behind column. Grips Aang from behind, pinning Aang's arms behind him.] The Avatar's coming with me!

Quickly!"], ["Katara", "[Chained. Sees him coming toward her. Turns head toward the closing door.] Go!"], ["Katara", "[Pleased.] He made it!"], ["Aang", "[Stands. Confused.] The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?"], ["Zuko", "[He and four sages launch fire blasts into the door's locks. Nothing happens. Frustrated.] Why isn't it working, it's sealed shut?"], ["Great Fire Sage", "It must have been the light. Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside."], ["Aang", "[Exasperated. Standing in the middle of the room, facing the statue.] Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending!

[Aang respectfully places a fist into his palm, bowing his head to the Avatar before him.]"], ["Zuko", "[Firmly to Shyu, who is kneeling before him with his hands behind his back.] Why did you help the Avatar?"], ["Shyu", "[Sadly and proudly.] Because it was once the sages' duty. It is still our duty."], ["Zhao", "[Claps. Interrupts interrogation. Approaches with six firebender guards.] What a moving and heartfelt performance. I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand, when you explain why you betrayed him."], ["Great Fire Sage", "[Places palms together. Bows head forward.] Commander Zhao."], ["Zhao", "And Prince Zuko. It was a noble effort, but your little smokescreen didn't work. [Zuko scowls sharply. Firebenders step behind him, seizing his arms.] Two traitors in one day, the Fire Lord will be pleased."], ["Zuko", "[Strains against his captor, snaps at Zhao.] You're too late, Zhao!

That is why, when you were in the Spirit World, I sent my dragon to find you."], ["Aang", "[Interested, curious.] Is it about that vision? The one of the comet?"], ["Roku", "Yes."], ["Aang", "What does it mean?"], ["Roku", "One hundred years ago, [Viewers see a visual of a comet in the dark sky.] Fire Lord Sozin used that comet to begin the War. He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power, and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations."], ["Aang", "[Close-up.] So the comet made them stronger?"], ["Roku", "[Close-up.] Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine."], ["Aang", "[Close-up.] But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the War now?"], ["Roku", "Listen carefully. [Viewers see silhouette of Fire Lord Ozai standing amid flames, fists taut.] Sozin's Comet will return by the end of the summer, and Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the War, once and for all.

What if I fail?"], ["Roku", "I know you can do it Aang. [Close-up of half his face.] For you have done it before. [Close-up of half of Aang's now-smiling face.] The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways, for now."], ["Aang", "But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? How will I talk to you?"], ["Roku", "I am a part of you. When you need to talk to me again, you will find a way. [Closes his eyes, providing Aang a vision of Fire Navy ships surrounding the island. Speaks to his mind without words.] A great danger awaits you at the temple. [Provides a vision of the awaiting firebenders on the other side of the door.] I can help you face the threat.

I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives."], ["Sokka", "[In a sarcastic, amused tone while facing Aang.] Well, let's see.

We have it, we might as well learn from it."], ["Iroh", "I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace."], ["Zuko", "It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time for everyone!"], ["Iroh", "Quite the contrary.

Stupid scroll! [The pirate captain and Zuko are shown hearing her.] Okay Katara, shift your weight through the stances. [She drops the water again and hears the ship pulling up onto the river bank.

[Zoom backward to show Sokka in the foreground.]"], ["Sokka", "Okay, I've seen enough."], ["Katara", "How can you not be fascinated Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world."], ["Sokka", "Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away."], ["Gan Jin tribesman", "[Shoving past Sokka.] If you're looking for the canyon guide, I was here first!"], ["Katara", "Ooh, canyon guide? Sounds informative."], ["Gan Jin tribesman", "Believe me, he's more than a tour guide, he's an earthbender, [Oblivious to the fact that Sokka is behind him, mocking him.] and the only way in and out of the canyon is with his help, and he's taking my tribe across next."], ["Sokka", "Calm down, we know you're next."], ["Gan Jin tribesman", "You wouldn't be so calm if the Fire Nation destroyed your home and forced you to flee! My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing Se."], ["Katara", "You're a refugee!"], ["Gan Jin tribesman", "Huh, tell me something I don't know."], ["Katara", "Is that your tribe?"], ["Gan Jin tribesman", "It most certainly is not! That's the Zhang tribe, a bunch of low-life thieves. They've been the enemies of my tribe for a hundred years. [Whistles to them.] Hey, Zhangs! I'm saving a spot for my tribe so don't even think about stealing it!"], ["Zhang leader", "Where are the rest of the Gan Jin? Still tidying up their camp site?"], ["Gan Jin tribesman", "Yes, but they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot."], ["Zhang leader", "I didn't know the canyon guide took reservations."], ["Gan Jin tribesman", "Ha, of course you didn't! That's the ignorance I'd expect from a messy Zhang. So unorganized and ill-prepared for a journey. [The Zhang tribe members yell out in protest behind them. Katara and Aang look at each other worriedly, but turn around to see a large pile of rocks being levitated up and thrown away. The canyon guide stands behind where the rocks used to be.]"], ["Canyon guide", "Sorry about the wait, youngsters. Who's ready to cross this here canyon?"], ["Katara", "Uh, one of them, I think.

[A group of clean, finely dressed people are shown coming toward them.]"], ["Zhang leader", "[To the canyon guide.] You're not seriously gonna cave into these spoiled Gan Jins? I mean we're refugees too! And we've got sick people that need shelter."], ["Canyon guide", "I ... uh ... well ..."], ["Gan Jin tribesman", "We've got old people who are weary from traveling."], ["Zhang leader", "Sick people get priority over old people."], ["Gan Jin leader", "Maybe you Zhangs wouldn't have so many sick people if you weren't such slobs."], ["Zhang leader", "If you Gan Jins weren't so clean, you wouldn't live to be so old."], ["Katara", "[Over the two arguing tribes.] Well Aang, ready to put your peace-making skills to the test?"], ["Aang", "I don't know, a fight over chores is one thing, but these people have been feuding for a hundred years."], ["Katara", "[Stepping forward.] Everybody listen up! This is the Avatar, and if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy."], ["Aang", "Uh, you could share the earthbender and travel together?"], ["Gan Jin leader", "Absolutely not! We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation than travel with those stinking thieves!"], ["Zhang leader", "We wouldn't travel with those pompous fools anyway! [The two tribes begin to shout at each other again.]"], ["Aang", "[Shouting.] All right here's the deal, you're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across! Does that seem fair?

Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?"], ["Aang", "[Grinning broadly.] To tell you the truth, I'm not sure. But when have I ever been?"], ["Katara", "He's the Avatar, Sokka, making peace between people is his job."], ["Sokka", "[Dismayed.] His job's gonna make us cross this whole canyon on foot isn't it?

All food better be in your gut or in the garbage!"], ["Aang", "[To the people on Appa.] Appa's going to take good care of you 'till we get there. [To Appa.] See you on the other side, buddy! Yip yip!

The tour guide earthbends to form a bridge in a gap in the path.]"], ["Aang", "Nice bending!"], ["Canyon guide", "The job's much more than bending, kid. Folks want information. [Turns to the travelers.] Many of you are probably wondering how canyons are formed. Experts tell us this canyon was most likely carved into the ground by earth spirits who were angry at local farmers for not offering them a proper sacrifice."], ["Canyon guide", "He he he, guess the spirits are still angry! Hope you all brought sacrifices."], ["Canyon guide", "Okay, everyone stand clear of the wall. [He throws the boulder and destroys the bridge he had made earlier.]"], ["Aang", "Why'd you do that?"], ["Canyon guide", "These people are fleeing the Fire Nation, aren't they? Gotta make sure we can't be followed. We'll be safe now. [Yells out, as he is picked up by a huge animal. Aang blows away the dust to reveal a canyon crawler.]"], ["Sokka", "We gotta help him! [He throws his boomerang at the crawler, which drops the canyon guide and comes after Sokka instead.] Okay, now we gotta help me! [Katara comes to his aid and does a water whip on the crawler, but she is quickly thrown aside. Aang jumps down and sends a multiple blasts of air at the crawler and drives it away.]"], ["Aang", "[To the canyon guide.] What was that?"], ["Canyon guide", "[On the ground.] Canyon crawler. [Groans in pain.] And there's sure to be more!"], ["Katara", "Your arms, they're broken!"], ["Canyon guide", "Without my arms, I got no bending. In other words-"], ["Aang", "We're trapped in this canyon."], ["Sokka", "I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like canyon crawlers."], ["Gan Jin leader", "It's the Zhangs! They took food down here even after the canyon guide told them not to."], ["Zhang leader", "What? If there's anyone who can't go without food for a day, it's you pampered Gan Jins!"], ["Gan Jin leader", "I hope you're happy.

I won't die down here! I won't become part of the food chain!"], ["Gan Jin leader", "See! We're going to become part of the food chain because of you! [Points to Zhangs.]"], ["Zhang leader", "Sure, unjustly blame the Zhangs like you always do!"], ["Gan Jin leader", "Gladly."], ["Aang", "[Angrily.] Enough! I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not gonna happen. [Jumps onto a tall rock.] We should split up, Gan Jins on this side and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines. [The two leaders nod at each other and start walking. Aang jumps down to Sokka and Katara.] Sokka, you go with the Zhangs and Katara, you go with the Gan Jins. See if you can find out why they hate each other so much."], ["Sokka", "So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?"], ["Zhang leader", "What for? Its the dry season."], ["Sokka", "Exactly!"], ["Zhang leader", "Besides, we like to use the tarp as a blanket."], ["Sokka", "[Smiling.] Finally, someone gets it!"], ["Katara", "You really think it'll rain?"], ["Gan Jin leader", "No, but you can never be too careful, right?"], ["Gan Jin leader", "Would you care for some bread, Katara?"], ["Katara", "So it was you guys who had food!"], ["Gan Jin leader", "Oh come now, you really think that tribe of thieves isn't smuggling food? Why should my people go hungry when the sneaky Zhangs are stuffing their faces?"], ["Katara", "[Hesitates.] Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it. [Takes the bread and eats it.] So, why does your tribe hate the Zhangs so much?"], ["Gan Jin leader", "You seem like a smart girl Katara, I bet you would enjoy hearing some history. [Fades to show a large gate with a finely dressed man running toward it. Voice-over.] The patriarch of our tribe, Jin Wei, was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty, transporting our sacred orb from the great eastern gate, to the great western gate. Taking the orb from the east to the west represents the sun's rising and setting. It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual. But as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang, a vermin named Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy. That coward Wei Jin knocked Jin Wei to the ground, and stole our sacred orb. [Camera goes back to the Gan Jin leader's face.] Our people have never forgotten. You can never trust a Zhang."], ["Zhang leader", "[To Sokka.] Care for some meat?"], ["Sokka", "Would I! [Takes the meat and bites down hungrily.]"], ["Zhang leader", "I know what you must be thinking, we're horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here."], ["Sokka", "Hm-hmm."], ["Zhang leader", "The Gan Jin think so badly of us, they probably assumed we brought food in and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in."], ["Sokka", "[Still eating.] Hmm."], ["Zhang leader", "Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years. [Fades to show a poorly-dressed man running through a large gate. Voice-over.] Our forefather Wei Jin was leaving the western gate of our village, when he saw a figure in the distance. It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground. Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb, a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual. Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important, and asked him to take it back to his tribe. Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could, but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory, he was arrested. Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed, they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison. [Back to Zhang leader.] We Zhangs will never forget that injustice."], ["Sokka", "That's just terrible. [Looks at her piece of meat.] You gonna finish that?"], ["Aang", "Sure would be nice to be sitting around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing. Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts! [Momo jumps up and snatches a bug out of the air, he eats part of it before offering the rest to Aang.] Nah, I'll wait for the leechi nuts."], ["Canyon guide", "[Slowly approaching Aang.] Lonely isn't it, being impartial?"], ["Aang", "I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here."], ["Canyon guide", "I'm not so sure the two problems are unrelated."], ["Canyon guide", "All clear, we're almost to the other side."], ["Aang", "[Jumps down to Katara and Sokka.] Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?"], ["Katara", "I don't think so, Aang, the Zhangs really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin Wei and stole the sacred orb."], ["Aang", "What are you talking about?"], ["Sokka", "Yeah Katara, what are you talking about? Wei Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin."], ["Katara", "Not punished enough if you ask me."], ["Aang", "[Over Sokka's frustrated growls.] Okay, okay I get it! Now I need your help, I need everyone together at the base of the canyon wall. [He takes off on his glider and the scene fades to show him landing between the two tribes.] Please everyone, as soon as we get out of here we can eat and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff."], ["Gan Jin leader", "Maybe the Zhang can climb the wall with their long disgusting fingernails."], ["Zhang leader", "Oh sorry, I forgot that to the Gan Jin unclipped fingernails is a crime punishable by twenty years in jail!"], ["Gan Jin leader", "Why, you dirty thief!"], ["Zhang leader", "You pompous fool!"], ["Aang", "[Shouting.] Guys, focus! How many times do I have to say it? Harsh words won't solve problems, action will!"], ["Zhang leader", "Perhaps the Avatar is right."], ["Gan Jin leader", "Yes, perhaps he is. [Aang grins happily at this.]"], ["Zhang leader", "Harsh words will never solve our problems."], ["Gan Jin leader", "Action will!"], ["Gan Jin leader", "To the death! And let this be the end of this rivalry!"], ["Aang", "You know, I take it back. Harsh words aren't so bad!"], ["Aang", "[Shocked.] Is that ... food? Everyone smuggled food down here? Unbelievable! You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day? You're all awful! [He looks in wonder at a custard tart, and his stomach growls.] So hungry. Is that an egg custard in that tart? [He turns to see dozens of canyon crawlers approaching, and they all try to flee.]"], ["Katara", "Oh no, that's a lot of canyon crawlers."], ["Sokka", "[Taking out his boomerang.] We barely survived one!"], ["Canyon guide", "They're coming back for me! They've had a taste and they're coming back for me!"], ["Katara", "Sokka, wait. [Stops him as he runs forward.] I don't care about this stupid feud, I just want us to get out of here alive."], ["Sokka", "Me too. I only took their side 'cause they fed me."], ["Aang", "[Shouting.] Everybody, watch me and do what I do! [He distracts a crawler with a piece of food, leaps on its back, and throws a bag over its snout. The two tribes mimic him, working together.] Now follow me! We're riding out of this hole! [Aang ties a huge bag of food onto a stick and uses it to guide the crawlers up the canyon wall.] Everyone, get off!"], ["Zhang leader", "[Jumping off a crawler.] We made it!"], ["Zhang leader", "I never thought a Gan Jin could get his hands dirty like that."], ["Gan Jin leader", "And I never knew you Zhangs were so reliable in a pinch."], ["Zhang leader", "Perhaps we're not so different after all. [They both smile at each other and Aang sighs in relief.]"], ["Gan Jin leader", "Too bad we can't rewrite history. You thieves stole our sacred orb from Jin Wei! [Draws his sword.]"], ["Zhang leader", "[Draws her sword.] You tyrants unjustly imprisoned Wei Jin for twenty long years!"], ["Aang", "[Sighs in frustration.] Wait a second ... Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys!"], ["Gan Jin leader", "Yes, yes, we're all aware of the story."], ["Aang", "No, I mean I really knew them. I might not look it, but I'm a hundred and twelve years old. I was there one hundred years ago on the day you're talking about. [Scene fades to show the two men facing each other. Voice-over.] There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened. First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies. They were brothers, twins in fact, and they were eight; and most importantly, they were just playing a game! The sacred orb from the legend, that was the ball! And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts. Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Wei Jin didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it toward the other goal, but he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box. Not for twenty long years but for two short minutes. [Fades back to Aang.] There was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison, it was just a game."], ["Zhang leader", "You're saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball?"], ["Aang", "Nope, just a regular ball."], ["Gan Jin man", "What about our tribe's redemption ritual?"], ["Aang", "That's what the game was called, redemption. As soon as you got the ball from one end to the other, everyone would yell \"redemption\"! [The tribe leaders look at each other skeptically.] Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true. But they respected each other's differences enough to share the same playing field."], ["Zhang leader", "[To the Gan Jin leader.] I suppose it's time we forget the past."], ["Gan Jin leader", "[Bowing.] And look to the future."], ["Aang", "Good to see you, boy.

The man you are going to marry."], ["Katara", "[Excitedly.] Tell me more!"], ["Wu", "I can see that he's a very powerful bender."], ["Sokka", "Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break."], ["Aang", "Yeah ... when I was in there ..."], ["Sokka", "[Disgusted, looking away and holding up a hand to signal Aang to stop.] I don't even want to know!"], ["Wu", "[Entering the room with Katara.] Who's next?"], ["Sokka", "[Rising.] Okay, let's get this over with."], ["Wu", "[Dryly.] Your future is full of struggle and anguish. Most of it, self-inflicted."], ["Sokka", "[Holding up his hands in protest.] But you didn't read my palms or anything!"], ["Wu", "I don't need to. It's written all over your face. [Sokka resumes picking his teeth in disgust; to Aang.] You there, come with me."], ["Wu", "This is the most reliable method of telling your fortune. The bones never lie. [Urging Aang to pick a bone.] Go on, pick one. [Aang takes one bone and they sit down.] Now throw it on the fire. [Aang tosses the bone into the fire.] The heat makes cracks in the bone and I read the bone cracks to tell your destiny."], ["Aang", "Wow, that's a big crack."], ["Wu", "[Surprised.] I've never seen this before!"], ["Wu", "[Her and Aang shielding their faces in surprise.] Oh my! [Cuts to shot of the bone lying in the fire and back to Aunt Wu who is fascinated.] Your destiny! This is incredible. You will be involved in a great battle, an awesome conflict between the forces of good and evil. A battle whose outcome will determine the fate of the whole world!"], ["Aang", "[Casually.] Yeah, yeah, I knew that already. But did it say anything about a girl?"], ["Wu", "[Surprised.] A girl? You want to know about love?"], ["Aang", "[Excited.] Yes!"], ["Wu", "I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything."], ["Wu", "[Trying to cheer him up.] Well, look! [Holding her hand against her face in mock forgetfulness.] I must've missed something. [Cuts to a bone piece lying on the floor; Wu picks it up.] Right here. [Holds bone up to examine it.] It says \"trust your heart and you will be with the one you love.\""], ["Aang", "Really? [Rises to his feet joyfully.] Thank you, Aunt Wu!"], ["Sokka", "Well, now you got to see for yourselves how fortune telling is just a big, stupid hoax."], ["Katara", "You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life."], ["Sokka", "[Voice rising in anger.] That woman is crazy! My life will calm and happy and joyful!"], ["Sokka", "That doesn't prove anything!"], ["Katara", "[Satisfied.] Well, I liked my predictions. [Clasps her hands together anxiously.] Certain things are going to turn out very well."], ["Aang", "[Slyly, crossing his arms and leaning in toward her.] They sure are ..."], ["Katara", "Why? What did she tell you?"], ["Aang", "[Ambiguously.] Some stuff. You'll find out."], ["Katara", "[Looking at the sky.] What's with the sky?"], ["Calm man", "[Also viewing the sky.] We are waiting for Aunt Wu to come and read the clouds to predict the fate of the whole village."], ["Aang", "[Pointing upward.] That cloud kind of looks like a fluffy bunny."], ["Calm man", "[Slightly worried.] You better hope that's not a bunny! The fluffy bunny cloud forecasts doom and destruction."], ["Sokka", "[Disgusted.] Do you even hear yourself?"], ["Village Woman", "[Gesturing to the mountain in the background.] The cloud reading will tell us if Mt. Makapu will remain dormant for another year or if it will erupt."], ["Calm man", "We used to have a tradition once a year of going up the mountain to check the volcano ourselves. [Smiles.] But every since Aunt Wu moved to the village twenty years ago, we have a tradition of not doing that."], ["Sokka", "I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy, old woman's superstition!"], ["Katara", "[Laying a hand on Sokka's shoulder.] Shhh! She's coming!"], ["Meng", "[Trying to impress him.] Hey, Aang. [Pointing upward.] Don't you think that cloud looks like a flower?"], ["Aang", "[Awkwardly.] Huh? Sure, I guess. [He pushes Meng away as the camera pans to the right; to Katara.] Hey, Katara, don't you think that cloud look like a flower?"], ["Katara", "[Annoyed.] Shhh!"], ["Wu", "[Thoughtfully.] Bending arrow cloud ... good crops this year. Nice big harvest."], ["Farmer", "[Hugs elderly woman happily.] Darn good news!"], ["Wu", "Wavy, moon-shaped cloud ... let's see. [Smiling.] Gonna be a great year for twins!"], ["Poi and Ping", "[High-five each other joyfully.] Yes!"], ["Wu", "[Thoughtfully.] And a cumulus cloud with a twisted nob coming off the end of it ... [Spreads arms outward again.] The village will not be destroyed by the volcano this year!"], ["Aang", "[Slightly nervous.] Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you. I like you, but more than normal."], ["Aang", "[Crushed.] Never mind."], ["Katara", "Hi, Aunt Wu! Sorry to bother you."], ["Wu", "Any time."], ["Katara", "About this man I'm supposed to marry ... [Looks down awkwardly and blushes.] Is he going to be handsome? [Clasps her hands together hopefully.] Oh, I hope he's tall!"], ["Wu", "Ah ... You want another reading?"], ["Katara", "Yes, please!"], ["Sokka", "I can't believe all these saps! [Cuts to side-view of Sokka walking forward, Aang following close behind.] Someone really needs to scream some sense into them."], ["Aang", "They seem happy, Sokka."], ["Sokka", "Not for long. I'm going to prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense. [Pulls over a man standing nearby.] Hey you, I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she? [Cuts to shot of the man's red shoes.]"], ["Man", "Yeah. She said I'd be wearing red shoes when I met my true love."], ["Sokka", "Uh huh ... And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?"], ["Man", "[Smiles sheepishly.] Everyday."], ["Sokka", "[Background becomes a spiral of swirling orange and yellow flames; angry.] Then of course it's gonna come true!"], ["Man", "[Delighted.] Really? You think so? [Begins walking away.] I'm so excited!"], ["Wu", "And then you will have your third great-grandchild before quietly passing away in your sleep. [Cuts to shot of Aunt Wu, who does not seem particularly happy.] Is that enough information for you?"], ["Katara", "[Lifts her palm in wonder.] Wow, thanks, Aunt Wu. [She rises and prepares to leave, but suddenly turns back.] Oh wait, one more thing. How warmly should I dress tomorrow?"], ["Wu", "You want me to do a reading for that?"], ["Sokka", "[Crazed.] I don't care what Aunt Wu told you! You have to take a bath sometime!"], ["Aang", "So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?"], ["Sokka", "[Pleased.] Some stuff? [Places an arm around Aang's shoulders.] You've come to the right place. What can I do you for?"], ["Aang", "Well, there's this girl."], ["Sokka", "[Thinking of Meng rather than Katara.] I think I know who you mean."], ["Aang", "[Surprised.] You do? And you're okay with it?"], ["Sokka", "Of course I am. And to tell you the truth, I've been picking up a subtle vibe that she likes you, too."], ["Aang", "[Growing anxious; Meng tries to catch Aang's attention in the background.] She does?"], ["Sokka", "Oh yeah, she's crazy about you. All you have to do now is not mess it up."], ["Aang", "Well, how do I do that?"], ["Sokka", "The number once mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice."], ["Aang", "You can be too nice?"], ["Sokka", "Yep. If you want to keep her interested, you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other."], ["Aang", "Well, okay ..."], ["Meng", "Hey, Aang, I was wondering ..."], ["Aang", "See you later ... [Walks away casually and waves hand breezily.]"], ["Sokka", "[Impressed.] Wow, that kid is good."], ["Wu", "And you'll be fine as long as you've got a scarf. Bye-bye now."], ["Katara", "Okay, okay, but one more thing."], ["Wu", "[Stares horrified at Katara before sighing and leaning forward slightly in surrender.] All right, what is it?"], ["Katara", "[Puts a hand to her chin thoughtfully.] Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?"], ["Wu", "[Angrily.] Papaya! [Slams the door shut.]"], ["Katara", "[Kicks the ground, sending up a small cloud of dust.] Aww, I hate papaya."], ["Aang", "[Breezily.] Oh, hey, Katara. I didn't see you there."], ["Katara", "[Half-heartedly.] Hey, Aang. [Walks away.]"], ["Aang", "[Trying to catch her attention.] That's okay. I'm busy with my own stuff."], ["Katara", "[Less than pleased.] Ugh, papaya please."], ["Aang", "[Aloof.] So ... papaya."], ["Katara", "Uh huh. Would you like some?"], ["Aang", "[Causally, picking an apple from the stand.] You know me. I don't really care what I eat."], ["Katara", "[Begins walking away.] Okay then. See you later."], ["Aang", "[Slightly downcast.] Maybe aloof isn't my style."], ["Woman", "[From afar; delighted.] Oh, a panda lily!"], ["Aang", "[To Momo.] Did you see that?"], ["Aang", "Excuse me. [Pointing to the flower.] Where can a guy find one of those things?"], ["Sokka", "[Off-camera.] I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower."], ["Aang", "Not just any flower, a panda lily. I've seen it in action and boy, does it work."], ["Sokka", "Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage, it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness."], ["Aang", "But my heart is telling me to get this flower, [Looks up toward the rim of the mountain.] and Aunt Wu said if I trusted in my heart, I will be with the one I love."], ["Sokka", "[Irritated.] What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff, too."], ["Aang", "[Cuts to shot of Aang perched on one boulder, Sokka appearing on-screen.] Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet. Why should she be wrong about love? [Leaps upward and points in delight at the rim.] There! On the rim!"], ["Aang", "[Shocked.] Oh no. [Cuts to overhead shot of the volcano.] Aunt Wu was wrong."], ["Sokka", "Those people all think they're safe! We've got to warn them!"], ["Aang", "There's no time to walk! [Whips out his glider.] Grab on! [He pulls Sokka forward, who shouts in surprise and the two take off.]"], ["Aang", "[Shyly, raises hand slightly.] Hi, Katara."], ["Katara", "[Annoyed.] Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business I've given her?"], ["Aang", "But she doesn't even charge."], ["Katara", "I know, but still ..."], ["Sokka", "Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano."], ["Katara", "[Slightly irked, raises finger accusingly.] Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before. It's going to take an awful lot to change my mind -"], ["Katara", "[Worriedly.] Oh no."], ["Sokka", "[Urgently.] Everyone, that volcano is gonna blow any second! Aunt Wu was wrong!"], ["Village Woman", "[Not buying his claim.] Yeah, yeah, we know you don't believe in Aunt Wu, Mr. science and reason lover."], ["Katara", "[Stepping forward.] If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me. I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes."], ["Calm man", "[Unmoved.] Well, I heard Aunt Wu's prediction with my own ears."], ["Aang", "[Leaps onto the awning of a nearby building; urgently.] Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here! You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction, [Cuts to shot of villagers who gaze up at him, seemingly listening.] you have to take fate into your own hands!"], ["Sokka", "Look! [Points to the volcano.] Can your fortune telling explain that?"], ["Man with Red Shoes", "[Amused.] Can your science explain why it rains?"], ["Sokka", "[Turns to him; yells angrily.] Yes! Yes, it can!"], ["Katara", "[Dismayed.] They just won't listen to reason. [Aang leaps down from the awning.]"], ["Aang", "[Brightening.] But they will listen to Aunt Wu!"], ["Sokka", "I know that's the problem."], ["Aang", "Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own hands. First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book."], ["Aang", "[Whispering.] Shhh! We don't want anyone to hear us."], ["Aang", "Oh, I didn't see you there."], ["Meng", "[Sadly.] You don't like me, do you? [Her ears droop down.]"], ["Aang", "Of course I like you."], ["Meng", "[Downcast.] But not the way I like you."], ["Aang", "Oh, I guess not."], ["Meng", "It's okay. It's just really hard when you like someone, but they don't think of you that way."], ["Aang", "[Casting sad glance to the side.] I know what you mean."], ["Meng", "[Off-camera.] She's beautiful, by the way."], ["Aang", "[Blushes and looks at her, surprised.] Huh?"], ["Meng", "[Cuts to shot of the two standing in the room.] That Water Tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much. [Clasps hands together, counts on her fingers.] She's sweet, she's a bender [Cuts to shot of Meng.] and her hair seems so manageable. [While saying this last part, she tries to smooth down her braids only for them to immediately stick up again.]"], ["Aang", "Don't worry. You're going to meet a great guy who's going to completely fall for you. I know it. [Places a hand on her shoulder comfortingly; turns to leave.]"], ["Meng", "Thanks. [Holds up hand in alert.] Wait! Don't you want this? [Aang looks surprised; Meng hands him the cloud reading book, revealing she had had it in her possession the whole time.]"], ["Aang", "How did you know?"], ["Meng", "[Nervously playing with her fingers.] I've kind of been stalking you. [Smiles sheepishly.] Heh ..."], ["Aang", "[Blushing.] Oh, thanks ... I guess."], ["Aang", "Clouds are made of water and air, so between the two of us, we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want."], ["Katara", "[Reading Aunt Wu's book.] I found it. The symbol for volcanic doom."], ["Sokka", "Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds."], ["Wu", "[Quizzically.] That's very strange. It shouldn't ...

[Gesturing toward Sokka, who stands on the pagoda.] Sokka has a plan."], ["Sokka", "[Making motions with his arm.] Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot. If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river."], ["Aang", "If any of you are earthbenders, come with me."], ["Poi", "[Raising hand.] I'm an earthbender!"], ["Ping", "[Raising hand.] I'm not!"], ["Sokka", "Everybody else grab a shovel [As another explosion resonates over the village, everyone stumbles before regaining balance.] Come on! We've gotta hurry!"], ["Sokka", "[Resuming work.] Dig faster! Dig faster!"], ["Aang", "Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe!"], ["Katara", "It's too much! It's gonna overflow!"], ["Sokka", "Man, sometimes I forget what a powerful bender that kid is. [Katara's expression changes at this, remembering Aunt Wu's words about her future marriage.]"], ["Katara", "Wait, what did you just say?"], ["Sokka", "[Casually.] Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender."], ["Katara", "[Slowly widens her eyes in realization; as if having an epiphany.] I suppose he is."], ["Aang", "[Sheepishly.] By the way, we kind of borrowed your book."], ["Wu", "So you messed with the clouds, did you?"], ["Wu", "[Laughs in amusement.] Very clever!"], ["Sokka", "No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortune telling."], ["Calm man", "[Cheerfully.] But Aunt Wu predicted the village wouldn't be destroyed and it wasn't. She was right, after all."], ["Sokka", "[Gets near the Calm man's face, through gritted teeth.] I hate you."], ["Katara", "[Holding Sokka by the shoulders and leading him away.] It's okay, Sokka. Everything's going to be all right."], ["Aang", "Can I ask you something?"], ["Wu", "Of course, honey."], ["Aang", "[Disappointed.] You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you? You just told me what I wanted to hear."], ["Wu", "I'll tell you a little secret, young airbender. [Gestures to the sky.] Just as you reshaped those clouds, [Cuts to shot of Aang, who smiles; off-camera.] you have the power to shape your own destiny."], ["Katara", "[Brightly.] Goodbye everyone!

[The siblings land Appa on the temple courtyard, out of the hazardous sky. Aang is still flying with the boy, and seems to be having fun at the surprise competition.]"], ["Colonists", "[Several children are on the ground, cheering on their friend.] Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done!"], ["Teo", "[The boy doesn't seem upset at Aang, and seems happy that he isn't angry for nearly flying into him.] Hey there, you're pretty good!"], ["Aang", "[Nonchalantly, but with a smirk.] Yeah, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding."], ["Teo", "[He is looking amazed, before thinking of his own plan.] Wow, I don't think I can do that. But here's a good one."], ["Teo", "What do you think?"], ["Aang", "[Annoyed; his face mimics the one Teo has just drawn.] It's great."], ["Teo", "Hey, you're a real airbender. You must be the Avatar! That's amazing! I-I've heard stories about you!"], ["Aang", "[Rubs his head, embarrassed.] Thanks."], ["Sokka", "[Sokka ignores all formalities, instead going over to Teo's chair and examining the strange shape and design.] Wow! This glider chair is incredible!"], ["Teo", "You think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my dad designed."], ["Sokka", "Wow! [Runs up to machines.]"], ["Teo", "Yeah, my dad is the mastermind behind this whole place. Everything's powered by hot air. [Shows women using an elevator like contraption.] It even pumps hot air currents outside to give us a lift while we're gliding."], ["Aang", "[Monotonously.] This place is unbelievable."], ["Teo", "Yeah, it's great, isn't it?"], ["Aang", "No, just unbelievable. [Walks away.]"], ["Katara", "[Katara approaches Teo, who seems disappointed at Aang's reaction.] Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so ... different."], ["Sokka", "So better!"], ["Aang", "This is supposed to be the history of my people."], ["Aang", "Ugh!"], ["Katara", "[Walks up and puts her hand on his shoulder.] I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same."], ["Aang", "It's nice to see that at least one part of the temple that isn't ruined."], ["Man", "[Off-screen.] Look out!"], ["Mechanist", "What the doodle? Don't you know enough to stay away from construction sites? We have to make room for the bathhouse! [He has approached Aang and the group, looking more surprised than upset.]"], ["Aang", "[He turns to the mechanist and yells angrily at him.] Do you know what you did!? You just destroyed something sacred! For a stupid bathhouse!"], ["Mechanist", "Well, people around here are starting to stink. [Waves his hand in front of his face, as though trying to dissipate a bad smell.]"], ["Aang", "[Points at the mechanist.] This whole place stinks! [Using his airbending, Aang flips the crane contraption off of the edge of the building.]"], ["Aang", "This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way! [Walks closer to the mechanist.] I've seen it when the monks were here! I know what it's supposed to be like!"], ["Mechanist", "The monks? But, [Scratches his beard.] you're twelve."], ["Teo", "[Teo rolls up.] Dad, he's the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago."], ["Aang", "What are you doing? Who said you could be here?"], ["Mechanist", "[Turns away from Aang.] Hmm, doing here ... A long time ago, [Points finger up.] but not a hundred years, my people became refugees [Walks behind his son's wheelchair.] after a terrible flood. My infant son, [Teo looks down sadly.] Teo, was badly hurt and lost his mother. [Sniffles.] I needed somewhere to rebuild and I stumbled across this place. Couldn't believe it! Everywhere! Pictures of flying people! But empty, [Looks around.] nobody home. Then, [Does a airplane like gesture, like he's flying up to Aang.] I came across these fan-like contraptions!"], ["Aang", "Our gliders."], ["Mechanist", "Yes! Little, light flying machines! [Waves his hands up and down.] They gave me an idea. Build a new life for my son, in the air! Then everyone will be on equal ground! So to speak. We're just in the process of improving upon what's already here. [Katara wipes her tears on Aang's shirt, and Sokka looks like he's holding back tears.] And, after all, isn't that what nature does?"], ["Aang", "Nature knows where to stop."], ["Mechanist", "I suppose that's true. Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us. Look at the time! [Points at candles.] Come! [To other workers.] The pulley system must be oiled before dark."], ["Sokka", "Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same."], ["Mechanist", "The candle will tell us. Watch. [Candle pops four times.]"], ["Sokka", "You put spark powder in the candle!"], ["Mechanist", "Four flashes. So it's exactly four hours past mid-day. Or, as I call it: four o'candle. [Sokka laughs. Cut to a frontal shot of the mechanist, pleased that Sokka is interested.] If you like that, wait till you see my finger-safe knife sharpener. [He holds up his left hand, revealing that three of the fingers are made of wood.] Only took me three tries to get it right. [He pulls off the three wooden fingers, and throws them into Sokka's hand.]"], ["Sokka", "[Horrified.] Aaah!"], ["Mechanist", "[Pokes Sokka in the back with his one remaining finger and gestures for him to come.] Follow me! [Sokka runs after him.]"], ["Teo", "Hey, Aang. I want to show you something."], ["Aang", "I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same."], ["Teo", "I don't know about that. The temple might be different [Picks up\u00a0hermit crab\u00a0from the ground.] but the creatures that live here [Hands it to Katara.] are probably direct descendants of the ones who lived here a long time ago."], ["Katara", "[Pokes hermit crab.] You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temple's origins. [Katara hands it to Aang. It moves around in his hand and he smiles.]"], ["Teo", "Besides, there's one part of the temple that hasn't changed at all."], ["Katara", "Hey, it's just like the one in the other temple!"], ["Teo", "[Confidently, with a matter-of-fact tone.] Only an airbender can open it, so inside it's completely untouched. Just the way the monks left it. I've always wondered what it's like in there ..."], ["Katara", "[She looks at him, as though slightly scared of his reaction. Her tone is gentle and questioning.] Aang?"], ["Aang", "[He turns away from the door and his friends.] I'm sorry. This is the last part of the temple that's the same as it was. I want it to stay that way."], ["Teo", "[Somewhat disappointed, although he tries not to let it show.] I completely understand. I just wanted you to know that it's here."], ["Aang", "Thanks. [All three start to walk away.]"], ["Sokka", "These lanterns are terrible. I can't see! [Opens the top of his lantern only to find them filled with fireflies.] Why would you want to use fireflies for light? [One flies out.]"], ["Mechanist", "Hey! Close that up! They'll get loose! [Sokka closes it.] Fireflies are a non-flammable light source. [Both begin to walk again.]"], ["Mechanist", "Cover your nose [Both plug their noses.] and hold your breath. [The mechanist opens an eye slot in the door, both look inside a pitch-black room.]"], ["Sokka", "[Nasally, due to his nose being blocked.] Okay ... so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room."], ["Mechanist", "[Closes eye slot.] Wrong. It's filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my first time here. Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time. Nearly blew my self and the whole place even more sky high! Thought my eyebrows would never grow back. [Pans up to his eyebrows.] Anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving. From time to time, we have gas leaks. And they're nearly impossible to find."], ["Sokka", "So, this place is an explosion waiting to happen."], ["Mechanist", "Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell, or touch."], ["Teo", "The wind will carry you. It supports something inside you. Something even lighter than air. [Shows Katara holding a glider and standing at the edge of a building.] And that something takes over when you fly. [Katara puts down her glider and looks up at the other people flying.]"], ["Katara", "[Nervously.] I've changed my mind. I think I was born without that something."], ["Teo", "[Laughs.] Impossible! Everybody has it!"], ["Aang", "Spirit."], ["Teo", "What?"], ["Aang", "Spirit. That's the something you're talking about."], ["Teo", "[Thoughtfully.] Yeah, I suppose it is."], ["Teo", "Are you ready?"], ["Katara", "No! [Jumps off anyway.] Aaaaah! [Starts to fall down wards, but eventually starts to fly straight. Her scream peters off as she begins laughing.] I can't believe I'm flying!"], ["Aang", "Just make sure you keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug! [Shows Momo flying by and eating a bug.]"], ["Katara", "Teo was right about the air. All I had to do was trust it, let it carry me."], ["Aang", "Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one! [Aang lands beside him on the building.] I've been thinking. If you want to see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you."], ["Teo", "Great!"], ["Katara", "Wait! [Katara flies by.] How do I land this thing? What if I land over a-ack-ack-bleck! Bug! Bug! Ack, that was a bug!"], ["Mechanist", "I said don't touch anything! [Comes over to help Sokka pick things up.] Oh, don't worry. That experiment's old, [Referring to the hot air balloon.] and that egg was just part of last week's lunch."], ["Sokka", "[He sniffs the air before wincing.] Ugh! Week old egg smell!"], ["Mechanist", "Quick, find that egg! [Both crawl around the floor looking for it.]"], ["Teo", "I can't believe I'm finally going to see what's inside!"], ["Sokka", "How can something so small that you can't even see it make such a big stink!?"], ["Mechanist", "That's the solution to our problem!"], ["Sokka", "Yeah ... [Both turn toward each other.] if we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up ..."], ["Mechanist", "... The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs!"], ["Sokka", "Then, if there's a leak ..."], ["Mechanist", "... You smell rotten eggs! Then, you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from ..."], ["Sokka", "And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!"], ["Both", "You're a genius! [Bell rings on one of his desks.]"], ["Mechanist", "Something's wrong. [Stands up.] I've go to go! [Runs out the door and Sokka follows.]"], ["Aang", "This is a nightmare."], ["Mechanist", "[Walks in with Sokka behind him.] You don't understand!"], ["Aang", "[Accusingly.] You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!"], ["Sokka", "[Angrily.] You make weapons for the Fire Nation?!"], ["Teo", "Explain all this! Now!"], ["Mechanist", "[He is hesitant, but resigned as he begins to explain.] It was about a year after we moved here. Fire Nation soldiers found our settlement. You were too young to remember this, Teo. They were going to destroy everything! Burn it to the ground! I pleaded with them, I begged them to spare us! They asked what I had to offer. I offered ... my services. You must understand. I did this for you!"], ["Aang", "When are they coming?"], ["Mechanist", "Soon. [Candle pops once.] Very soon."], ["Aang", "You can't give them more weapons."], ["Mechanist", "If I don't give them what they want, they will destroy this place!

The mechanist puts the fire out with a cloth.]"], ["Teo", "How can I be proud of you when your inventions are being used for murder?"], ["Mechanist", "I need some time to think. [Bell rings on his desk.] You need to leave! Go!"], ["Teo", "We're not leaving!"], ["Mechanist", "Then hide! Quickly! [They hide behind some of his inventions. the mechanist pulls a rope that opens a trapdoor, and a war minister from the Fire Nation is lifted into the room.]"], ["Qin", "You know better than to keep me waiting. Give me what you owe us so we can be on our way. [The mechanist looks down.] Well? Is there a problem?"], ["Mechanist", "[Hurredly.] No, right this way. [Gestures toward the door.]"], ["Aang", "The deal's off."], ["Qin", "The Avatar ..."], ["Mechanist", "Aang, don't get involved!"], ["Qin", "If I don't get what I came here for, the Fire Nation will burn this place to rubble!"], ["Aang", "Get out of here! [Slaps him in the face with an air swipe; continues off screen.] You're leaving empty-handed!"], ["Qin", "Then the destruction of this temple [Pointing at Aang.] will be on your head! [He leaves through the trap door and Aang airbends it shut.]"], ["Teo", "This is bad."], ["Sokka", "Very bad!"], ["Katara", "Aang, what are we going to do? How can we possibly keep them all away?"], ["Aang", "I'll tell you how. We have something they don't. [Points to the sky.] Air power. We control the sky. That's something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!"], ["Mechanist", "I want to help. [He appears at the door.]"], ["Aang", "Good. We'll need it."], ["Mechanist", "We finally got the war balloon working, thanks to Sokka. This boy's a genius!"], ["Sokka", "Thank you. You're a genius!"], ["Mechanist", "Thank you! [Katara and Aang exchange unamused glances.]"], ["Sokka", "See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air-borne, [Places the candle in the model.] but once it did, it just kept going. [He pulls a string connected to the model, putting it on the table.] You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?"], ["Katara", "Ugh, if only we knew. [Teo, Katara, and Aang laugh.]"], ["Sokka", "A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon."], ["Katara", "Huh, that's actually pretty smart."], ["Sokka", "Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs: [He begins listing them off on his fingers.] smoke, slime, fire, and ..."], ["Mechanist", "Stink! Never underestimate the power of stink!"], ["Girl", "[Looking over a ledge.] They're coming!"], ["Teo", "Are we ready?"], ["Katara", "[Worriedly.] Yes. But where's Sokka with the war balloon?"], ["Aang", "[Jumping off Appa.] We'll have to start without it."], ["Fire Nation soldier", "Take them out of the sky. Now!"], ["Aang", "We've got them on the run! We need more slime!"], ["Katara", "Those things are unstoppable!"], ["Teo", "[Thoughtfully, trying to remember what he knew.] I think I know how they work. I remember my dad tinkering with the counterbalancing system. Something to do with water. Works great, huh?"], ["Katara", "Water? Can you get me close to one?"], ["Teo", "No problem!"], ["Teo", "We're out of bombs!"], ["Katara", "Come on Sokka. [Side-view of Katara.] Where's that war balloon?"], ["Sokka", "Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?"], ["Mechanist", "The insignia! [Close-up of Fire Nation insignia.] They think we're on their side."], ["Sokka", "[Close-up of Sokka on war balloon.] Then I guess they won't see this coming. [Slices rope attached to a large bomb.]"], ["Mechanist", "[Cut to view of both balloon and advancing army.] Bombs away!"], ["Sokka", "Oh no, that was the last one. [Cut to tanks beginning to scale the cliffs.]"], ["Mechanist", "[Cut back to Sokka and the mechanist.] Wait a second. You smell that?"], ["Sokka", "Rotten eggs! [Cut to a view of the balloon and a large crevice in the ground below.] There! That's were the gas is escaping."], ["Mechanist", "What are you doing?

Our ride's here!"], ["Aang", "[Shocked.] You could earthbend? All along?"], ["King Bumi", "Well, they didn't cover my face."], ["Aang", "[Slightly annoyed and angry.] I don't understand. Why didn't you free yourself? Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded? What's the matter with you, Bumi?"], ["King Bumi", "[Calmly.] Listen to me, Aang. There are options in fighting, called jing. It's a choice of how you direct your energy."], ["Aang", "[Cut to a close-up of an annoyed Aang, counting along on his fingers as he sums up the different jings.] I know! There's positive jing when you're attacking, and negative jing when you're retreating."], ["King Bumi", "[Happily smiling.] ... and neutral jing when you do nothing!"], ["Aang", "[He looks shocked at his three raised fingers.] There are\u00a0three jings?"], ["King Bumi", "Well, technically there are eighty-five, but let's just focus on the third. Neutral jing is the key to earthbending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike."], ["Aang", "[Starting to understand.] That's why you surrendered, isn't it?"], ["King Bumi", "Yes, and it's why I can't leave now."], ["Aang", "[Disappointed.] I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending."], ["King Bumi", "Your teacher will be someone who has mastered neutral jing. You need to find someone who waits and listens before striking."], ["Aang", "[Happily.] Hey, Momo!"], ["King Bumi", "Momo's mastered a few jings himself!"], ["King Bumi", "Goodbye, Aang.

[He makes a grotesque movement with his arm before thrusting his face in the camera.] Airbending slice! [He resumes his place beside Katara, who is still looking annoyed by her brother. He makes a circular motion with his hands and points toward the door.] And we're on our way!"], ["Katara", "[Slightly mocking.] I think what \"Master Swish\" is trying to say [Serious tone as she looks at Aang.] is that you're supposed to be out saving the world. You can't do that locked up in here."], ["Aang", "[Unhappy.] I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer either. I need you guys to help prove my innocence."], ["Sokka", "How're we gonna to do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago."], ["Aang", "[Cunningly.] That's okay, Sokka. For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective."], ["Sokka", "[Content.] Well, I guess I could be classified as such."], ["Katara", "[Aiding Aang by playing Sokka's ego.] Yeah! Back home, he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky."], ["Sokka", "[Bragging.] Everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard, but I figured out it was Old Man Jarko wearing polar leopard boots! [Katara holds her hand to her brow, annoyed by Sokka's monologue.] See, a real eight hundred-pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks. [Aang is making fun of Sokka, Katara holds her hand to her mouth to refrain herself from bursting out in laughs.] Okay, I guess I am pretty good."], ["Aang", "So, you'll help me with my case?"], ["Sokka", "[Pretends to ponder about the question. Katara stares at him, trying to figure out what he is doing.] Fine! But I'm going to need some new props. [The camera spins around. When it stops again, Sokka is wearing a hat with a monocle.] I'm ready. [Katara looks surprised at his new outfit and giggles. Sokka extends his monocle to investigate her.] What?"], ["Tong", "This is the crime scene. [Cut to Sokka, who inquisitively looks around. He gazes directly into the camera lens through his magnifying glass, making his left eye appear huge. He moves on to investigate the walls of the shrine, while the mayor is standing at the edge of the cliff, pointing down at something.] This is the footprint of the killer, Kyoshi. [Sokka quickly squats beside the footprint to take a closer look at it.] It was at sunset, 370 years ago today, that she emerged from the temple, and struck down Chin the Great. After that tragic day, we built this statue to immortalize our great leader. [They all look up at a statue of Chin the Great, who has a raised left hand in triumph.] Feel free to appreciate it."], ["Sokka", "This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone. [Runs back over to the statue.] And we know that the statue was built after Chin died."], ["Katara", "[Excitedly drawing her conclusions.] So if they were built at the same time, that means\u2013"], ["Sokka", "[Shouting.] Shhh! I wanna solve it! [Pointing at the temple.] That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple!"], ["Katara", "That's a big hole in the mayor's story, [Disappointed.] but it's not enough to prove Aang's innocence."], ["Sokka", "You're right. [Blows soap bubbles with his dragon shaped pipe, while thinking about their next course of action.] We need to go to Kyoshi Island."], ["Katara", "[Surprised.] Where did you get that?"], ["Scary prisoner", "You got a bald head. [Aang looks up in wonder to see who is talking. Switch to Aang's angle of view. A man is standing in the shadows, only his outline is visible.] Some nice tattoos. [The man emerges from the shadows. He has a strong build, earrings in both ears, and his body has a large snake tattoo that covers the top of his chest and down his right arm. He suddenly charges Aang, letting out a load growl. He is stopped in his tracks by the chains around his neck. Aang slides down the wall in fear, while the man addresses him calmly.] You're going to fit in real well around here."], ["Koko", "[Angrily stamping her foot on the ground.] Where's Aangy?"], ["Katara", "[Gently breaks the news to Koko.] He couldn't be here, Koko."], ["Koko", "[Nagging.] I wanted to see Aangy ..."], ["Katara", "Oyaji! Aang is in jail. The town of Chin says he murdered their leader in a past life."], ["Sokka", "They say it was Kyoshi."], ["Oyaji", "[Shocked.] Kyoshi? That's crazy talk! I'll take you to her shrine. Maybe something there will help you clear her name."], ["Sokka", "[With feigned casualness.] So, uh ... what's Suki up to? Is she around?"], ["Oyaji", "Actually, she and the other warriors left to fight in the war. You kids had a big impact on Suki. She said you inspired her and she wanted to help change the world."], ["Sokka", "[He disappointedly slants his eyes.] Oh, well ... that's great."], ["Oyaji", "This temple was converted into a shrine to Kyoshi. The clerics tell us these relics are still connected to her spirit. That's her kimono."], ["Katara", "[Approvingly.] She had exquisite taste."], ["Oyaji", "Please don't touch!"], ["Sokka", "These fans ... [He picks up one of the fans and waves it back and forth.] They were her weapons, no?"], ["Oyaji", "[Sternly.] Also refrain from touching the fans."], ["Katara", "[Squatting beside a really big pair of brown boots.] These were her boots? Her feet must have been enormous!"], ["Oyaji", "[Proudly.] The biggest of any Avatar."], ["Katara", "[Realizing something.] Wait a minute ... big feet? [A flashback shows the much smaller footprint they saw at the edge of the cliff outside Chin Village.] Little footprint? [She happily exclaims her findings.] There's no way\u2013"], ["Sokka", "[Annoyed.] Special outfit? Hat and pipe? These things mean anything to you?"], ["Katara", "[Sarcastically.] You're right. I'm sorry. [She bows slightly in a mocking gesture.] Please."], ["Sokka", "[Dramatically raises his hand in the air.] Aha! [Showing his own boots to Oyaji.] There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint. [Moves toward Katara to explain everything to her.] And therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene."], ["Katara", "[Unimpressed.] Brilliant, Sokka. [Rolls her eyes.]"], ["Scary prisoner", "[In a very friendly voice that does not stroke with his scary appearances.] This girl you're talking about? She'll come around. You just gotta hang in there."], ["Aang", "[Hopeful.] You think so?"], ["Scary prisoner", "Sure."], ["Prisoner #2", "Yeah."], ["Sensitive ruffian", "You're a catch."], ["Aang", "[Doubtful.] I don't know ..."], ["Scary prisoner", "Hey! You're smart, handsome, funny. Not to mention you're the Avatar."], ["Aang", "[Smiling sincerely.] You guys are great."], ["Sensitive ruffian", "[Tears stream down his face while he talk in a very soft voice.] Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel. [He dries his tears and sniffs.]"], ["Oyaji", "This piece is called \"The Birth of Kyoshi\". [Sokka investigates the painting thoroughly.] It was painted at sunrise on this day this island was founded. Why, it was today in fact, three hundred and seventy years ago."], ["Sokka", "[Sokka spins around in shock, spitting out some of the bubbles he swallowed. Very surprised.] Three hundred and seventy years? Wait, [He grabs Oyaji by his collar.] are you sure it was today?"], ["Oyaji", "Oh, seeing how it's Kyoshi Day, yes, [He pulls himself free from Sokka's grasp and throws him back a little.] I'm sure."], ["Sokka", "[Staring at the painting again.] This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise. It took place at sunset. [Addresses Katara.] Look at the shadows."], ["Katara", "They point east. So the sun must have been in the west."], ["Oyaji", "So what?"], ["Sokka", "[Shoves Katara out of the way as she yelps.] If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime. She has an alibi! [Points his pipe dramatically toward the camera upon making his conclusion.]"], ["Katara", "Honorable Mayor, we've prepared a solid defense for the Avatar. We did an investigation and found some very strong evidence."], ["Tong", "Evidence? [Dismissive.] Hmph! That's not how our court system works."], ["Aang", "Then how can I prove my innocence?"], ["Tong", "Simple. I say what happened [He points to himself, before pointing to Aang.], then you say what happened, and then I decide who's right. [Everyone gasps at once, horrified by this news.] That's why we call it justice. Because it's \"just us.\""], ["Tong", "[Emotionally.] Everyone loved Chin the Great because he was so great. Then the Avatar showed up and killed him, and that's how it happened."], ["Guard", "[Very deep, monotone voice.] The accused will now present its argument."], ["Sokka", "[Raises his hand before his mouth to say some quiet, encouraging words.] You can do it, Aang. Just remember the evidence."], ["Aang", "[Still tied up, unsure.] Right ... evidence. [He shifts his eyes to the left while he is trying to remember what to say. Enthusiastically.] Ladies and gentlemen ... I'm about to tell you what really happened. And I will prove it with facts. Fact number one. [Raises his finger to count along but blanks out.] Uhhh ..."], ["Sokka", "[Whispers.] The footprint!"], ["Aang", "Oh, yeah. You see ... I have very large feet. [The camera tilts down to reveal his small feet. The villagers are unimpressed by his argument.] Furthermore ... your temple matches your statue. [The villagers look from one to the other, not knowing where Aang is going with this.] But ... I was in a painting at sunset. [He quickly ends his exposition with a big smile.] So, there you have it, I'm not guilty."], ["Sokka", "[Mumbles to Katara while they continue to smile.] He's dead."], ["Iroh", "Looks like you did some serious shopping. [He picks up a big, gold-colored teapot.] But where did you get the money?"], ["Zuko", "[Lazily resting against a tree trunk.] Do you like your new teapot?"], ["Iroh", "To be honest with you [He puts the pot down.], the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup. [Iroh walks over to Zuko and squats down beside him.] I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by. [Places a hand on Zuko's shoulder who closes his eyes as if he was holding something back.] But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty."], ["Zuko", "There's no honor for me without the Avatar."], ["Iroh", "Zuko ... [Sighs.] Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems. Not now."], ["Zuko", "[Turns away from his uncle.] Then there is no hope at all."], ["Iroh", "No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts. [Zuko bows his head as he listens to his uncle's wisdom.] In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength."], ["Katara", "Mayor Tong, I'd like for the court to hear one last testimony."], ["Tong", "I've already told you, it's just me and the accused. You can't call any witnesses!"], ["Katara", "This isn't just any witness. I'm going to call ... [Spreads her arms.] Avatar Kyoshi herself!"], ["Sokka", "[Whispering.] What are you doing?"], ["Katara", "[Hopeful.] Well, she is Aang's past life. Maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something."], ["Sokka", "[Plays with his magnifying glass.] I do believe in the power of stuff."], ["Tong", "[Angry.] This is a mockery of Chin Law!"], ["Katara", "[Pleading.] Please! If you could just wait one more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here!"], ["Aang", "[Higher pitch.] Hey, everybody! Avatar Kyoshi here. [Rapidly blinks his eyes.]"], ["Tong", "[Walking over to Aang.] This is ridiculous!

When do I get to pick?"], ["Sokka", "You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time."], ["Toph", "Hmph! [Slams her drink on the table and folds her arms. Cut to a shot of Zei.]"], ["Zei", "Of course, there's the matter of finding it. I've made several trips into the Si Wong Desert and almost died each time. [In a depressed voice.] I'm afraid that desert's impossible to cross."], ["Sokka", "Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?"], ["Zei", "A sky bison?! You actually have one?"], ["Zei", "[Runs toward the sandbenders.] Sandbenders, shoo, away from the bison!"], ["Zei", "Tell me, sky bison, are you the last of your breed? [Appa growls and Zei responds enthusiastically.] Delightful! I only wish I spoke his tongue. [Scratches Appa's head.] Oh, the stories this beast could tell. [Momo crawls up to Zei's side and starts chittering.] Shush, chatty monkey."], ["Aang", "[Examines the picture of the library.] Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here."], ["Toph", "[Groans in frustration.] Does this place even exist?"], ["Zei", "Some say it doesn't."], ["Toph", "[Eyes widen in surprise before narrowing.] Shouldn't you have mentioned that before? [Collapses on the saddle, putting her feet over the side.]"], ["Toph", "[Pointing over the side of the saddle with excitement.] There it is! [Everybody on Appa looks to where Toph is pointing, but they can only see sand dunes. Aang, Katara, and Sokka glare at Toph in annoyance for tricking them. Cut back to the shot of Toph.] That's what it will sound like when one of you spots it. [Waves her hand in front of her face with a blank grin to remind them of the fact that she is blind. She quickly goes back to clutching the saddle.]"], ["Katara", "It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant, ornate building from the air."], ["Sokka", "[Looks through his telescope and spots a tower. Pointing.] Down there, what's that?"], ["Katara", "[Holding the illustrations.] Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for. [Side shot.] The building in this drawing is enormous."], ["Sokka", "[To Zei.] What kind of animal is that?"], ["Zei", "I think that was one of the Knowledge Seekers. [Frontal shot.] Oh, we must be close to the library!"], ["Sokka", "[Looking at the illustration Katara is holding.] No, this is the library- look! [Camera pans down from the tower to the illustration.] It's completely buried."], ["Zei", "[Shouting dramatically.] The library is buried?! [Cut to a shot of the group standing in front of the spire. Zei runs forward. Depressed.] My life's ambition is now full of sand. [Collapses. Smiling, he lifts his head and reveals a small shovel in hand. Excitedly.] Well, time to start excavating. [He attempts to unearth the library using the tiny shovel. Cut to a close-up of the spire's surface as Toph places her palm against it.]"], ["Toph", "[Cut a small part of the library which Toph puts her hand on.] Actually, that won't be necessary. The inside seems to be completely intact. [Aerial shot.] And it's huge."], ["Sokka", "That fox thingy went in through a window. I say we climb up there and give it a look."], ["Toph", "I say you guys go ahead without me."], ["Katara", "You got something against libraries?"], ["Toph", "I've held books before. And I gotta tell you, they don't exactly do it for me."], ["Katara", "[Sheepishly.] Oh, right. Sorry."], ["Toph", "Let me know if they have something you can listen to."], ["Aang", "[To Appa.] Don't worry, buddy. I'm not making you go underground ever again. You can stay out here with Toph. [Walks off camera.]"], ["Toph", "[Awkwardly.] What's up?"], ["Zei", "Oh, it's breathtaking! [Shot changes to show Zei, Aang, and Sokka climb down the rope with owl arches in the background.] The spirit spared no expense in designing this place. [Pointing.] Look at those beautiful buttresses! [Cut to an above shot of Sokka, Aang, and Zei, who are hanging from the rope.\u00a0Sokka and Aang giggle at the word.] What's funny?"], ["Aang", "Nothing. We just like architecture."], ["Zei", "[Cut back to a smiling Zei.] As do I."], ["Zei", "My word! [Examines an owl mosaic above two pillars.] The exquisite mosaic handiwork of this tile-rendered avian symbol ... [Sokka, Katara, and Aang look at Zei quizzically.] Eh, nice owl."], ["Wan Shi Tong", "[Turns his head around.] I know you're back there."], ["Zei", "[Smiles and walks from behind the pillar and up to Wan Shi Tong.] Hello, I'm Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University."], ["Wan Shi Tong", "You should leave the way you came. [Looks to the side.] Unless you want to become a stuffed head of anthropology."], ["Sokka", "Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?"], ["Wan Shi Tong", "Indeed, I am Wan Shi Tong, \"He Who Knows Ten Thousand Things.\" And you are obviously humans, which, by the way, are no longer permitted in my study."], ["Aang", "What do you have against humans?"], ["Wan Shi Tong", "Hm! Humans only bother learning things to get the edge on other humans. [Cut to Zhao, studying scrolls in the library. Voice-over.] Like that firebender who came to this place a few years ago, looking to destroy his enemy. [Scene changes to the present.] So ... [Leans toward a sweating Sokka.] who are you trying to destroy?"], ["Sokka", "[Cut to his reflection in Wan Shi Tong's eye.] What? No-no-no-no destroying. We're not into that."], ["Wan Shi Tong", "[Blinks.] Then why have you come here?"], ["Sokka", "Um ... knowledge for knowledge's sake?"], ["Wan Shi Tong", "[Shot changes to him leaning toward Sokka.] If you're going to lie to an all-knowing spirit being, you should at least put some effort into it."], ["Sokka", "I'm not lying, I'm here with the Avatar, [Grabs Aang and puts him into the shot.] and he's the bridge between our worlds. He'll vouch for me. [Nudges Aang.]"], ["Aang", "Ow. [Frontal shot.] Uh, yeah, I'll vouch. We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit. [Side shot.] You have my word. [They bow to Wan Shi Tong.]"], ["Wan Shi Tong", "Hmm, very well. I'll let you peruse my vast collection [Shot changes to Zei, Aang, Katara, and Sokka looking hopefully.] on one condition. [They look at the spirit a little worriedly. Further overhead shot.] To prove your worth as scholars, you have to contribute some worthwhile knowledge."], ["Zei", "[Walks up to Wan Shi Tong holding a book and kneels down.] Please accept this tome as a donation to your library."], ["Wan Shi Tong", "[Frontal shot.] First edition, very nice. [Grabs the book with his wing.]"], ["Katara", "[Camera pans up to show her holding the waterbending scroll.] I have an authentic waterbending scroll."], ["Wan Shi Tong", "[Frontal shot.] Ooh, these illustrations are quite stylish. [Grabs the scroll.]"], ["Aang", "[Cut to him.] Uh ... oh, I know! [Grabs his wanted poster out of his shirt and shows it to Wan Shi Tong.] Hah!"], ["Wan Shi Tong", "I suppose that counts. [Takes the poster.]"], ["Sokka", "[Side shot of him walking forward.] Oh, great spirit, [Frontal shot of him holding a piece of string.] check this out. [Ties the string into a butterfly knot and shows it to Wan Shi Tong.] Ta-da! [Aang, Katara, and Zei look at Sokka with uncertainty.\u00a0Shot of Wan Shi Tong just looking at him in silence.] It's a special knot. That counts as knowledge!"], ["Wan Shi Tong", "[Frontal shot.] You're not very bright, are you? [Sokka grunts as Wan Shi Tong takes the knot.] Enjoy the library. [Jumps off the bridge and flies down to lower levels of the library.]"], ["Sokka", "[Narrows his eyes.] Bright enough to fool you."], ["Toph", "[To Appa.] So ... you like ... flying? [Appa purrs deeply and scratches his ear.] Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground where I can see. Well, I don't see the way you do. I feel the vibrations in the ground with my feet. [Closer shot of the two. Toph picks up a handful of sand and lets it fall.] But this sand is so loose and shifty, it makes everything look fuzzy. [Appa makes a rumbling groan with a further shot.] Not that there's anything wrong with fuzzy. [Appa grunts.]"], ["Aang", "[Holds the illustration up to show Sokka and Katara.] Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things."], ["Sokka", "[Pulls a book off the bookshelf with the symbols \u5b50\u767d on the cover.] Eh, I've seen weirder."], ["Katara", "[Walks up to Aang, carrying a book.] Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left-handed?"], ["Aang", "I always knew I was special."], ["Sokka", "[Reading from the parchment.] \"The darkest day in Fire Nation history.\" It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else.

Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago. [Collapses on his knees.] I need to know what happened on the darkest day.

It's a planetarium that shows the heavens moving."], ["Sokka", "Uh, this is beautiful, but how is it helpful?"], ["Katara", "Maybe these dials represent dates and times. Sokka, try entering that date from that parchment you took."], ["Sokka", "[Mock whispering.] Shh, Katara, not in front of the fox, he's with the owl."], ["Aang", "Wow, I got to hand it to you, Sokka. You picked the best mini-vacation for sure."], ["Katara", "Hey, wait. What happened to the sun?"], ["Aang", "[Narrows his eyes.] Great, you must have broken it."], ["Sokka", "[Walks next to Aang.] It's not broken. [Shot changes to show the sun piece of the planetarium covered by the moon piece.] The sun is behind the moon. It's a solar eclipse! It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history. Now I get it. [Grabs Aang's shoulders and shakes him.] Something awful happened on that day. I don't know what, but I do know why. Firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse. [Pushes Aang back.] Sorry."], ["Katara", "That makes sense. I mean, think what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders. This is huge."], ["Sokka", "[To the Knowledge Seeker.] Fine, you earned it. [Tosses the fox a snack from his bag. To Aang and Katara.] We've gotta get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se. We'll wait for the next eclipse, then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless. The Fire Lord is going down!"], ["Wan Shi Tong", "[Enters the shot from behind Sokka.] Mortals are so predictable, and such terrible liars. [Sokka gulps.

From the beginning, you intended to misuse this knowledge for evil purposes."], ["Sokka", "You don't understand. If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation. You saw what they did to your library. They're destructive and dangerous. We need this information."], ["Wan Shi Tong", "You think you're the first person to believe their war was justified?

Toph looks at the sinking library.] Library sinking. [Running up to the library.] Library sinking! [Punches both fists into the library to stop it from sinking. Her feet slip in the sand, so she pauses to solidify it.] Hi-yah!

The solar eclipse! It's just a few months away. [Takes out a piece of paper and writes down the date.] Got it. Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se."], ["Toph", "Don't make me put this down."], ["Toph", "No!

None of those will tell us where Appa is."], ["Katara", "No, but we can find out which way Ba Sing Se is. We can use the stars to guide us.

I was a troubled person and I let my anger get out of control, but I don't even have the gang now! I've put all that behind me!"], ["Katara", "You're lying!"], ["Toph", "[Walks up to Jet and feels the wall he is pinned to.] He's not lying."], ["Sokka", "How can you tell?"], ["Toph", "I can feel his breathing and heartbeat. When people lie, there's a physical reaction. He's telling the truth."], ["Aang", "Katara, we don't have any leads. If Jet says he can take us to Appa, we have to check it out."], ["Katara", "All right. [Points and looks angrily at Jet.] But we're not letting you out of our sight."], ["Jet", "This is the place I heard about."], ["Aang", "There's nothing here."], ["Katara", "[Preparing to waterbend in defense.] If this is a trap\u2013"], ["Jet", "I told you, I work nearby! Two guys were talking about some giant furry creature they had, I figured it must be Appa!"], ["Toph", "He was here! [She shows them a clump of Appa's fur.]"], ["Aang", "[Sadly.] We missed him. [An old white haired man with a push-broom crosses behind the slumping Aang.]"], ["Old Sweepy", "They took that big thing yesterday. [Aang straightens with a shocked look.] Shipped him out to some island. About time, I've been cleaning up fur, and various, uhhh ... leavings all day."], ["Aang", "[Aang swiftly moves closer to the man.] What island? Where's Appa?"], ["Old Sweepy", "Foreman said some rich royal type on Whaletail Island bought him up. Guess for a zoo or such. Though, could be the meat that'd be good."], ["Aang", "We've got to get to Whaletail Island! [Pauses.] Where's Whaletail Island? [Dejectedly.]"], ["Sokka", "[Looking at map.] Far, very far. [Puts the map on the ground as they all gather round.] Here it is. It's near the South Pole, almost all the way back home."], ["Katara", "Aang, it will take us weeks just to get to the tip of the Earth Kingdom. And then we'll need to find a boat to get to the island."], ["Aang", "I don't care. We have a chance to find Appa! We have to try!"], ["Old Sweepy", "Must be nice to visit an island. I haven't had a vacation for years."], ["Katara", "Don't you have some more hair to clean up?"], ["Old Sweepy", "Shuffle on, I get you. No more need for Old Sweepy ..."], ["Katara", "You're right Aang, right now our first concern has to be finding Appa. We can come back when we have him."], ["Sokka", "All right, let's get moving."], ["Jet", "I'll come with you."], ["Katara", "We don't need your help!"], ["Jet", "Why won't you trust me?

How did you get away from the Dai Li?

We saw them drag him away!"], ["Jet", "Why would I be arrested? I've been living peacefully in the city!"], ["Toph", "[Feeling the ground between Jet and Smellerbee.] This doesn't make any sense. They're both telling the truth."], ["Katara", "That's impossible."], ["Sokka", "No it's not! Toph can't tell who's lying because they both think they're telling the truth. Jet's been brainwashed!"], ["Jet", "That's crazy! It can't be! [Glances to the sides.] Stay away from me!"], ["Zuko", "Out of my way, skinny!"], ["Dai Li agent", "Huh?"], ["Zuko", "If you don't want to end up like him, you'll do what I say."], ["Katara", "The Dai Li must have sent Jet to mislead us, and that janitor was part of their plot, too!"], ["Aang", "I bet they have Appa here in the city. Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet! Where did they take you?"], ["Jet", "Nowhere! I- I don't know what you're talking about!"], ["Aang", "We need to find a way to jog his real memories."], ["Sokka", "[Teasingly.] Maybe Katara should kiss him. That should bring something back!"], ["Katara", "Maybe you should kiss him, Sokka!"], ["Sokka", "Hey, just an idea!"], ["Aang", "A bad one."], ["Sokka", "Ooh, wait! I've got it!"], ["Jet", "I don't think it's working. [Spits it out.]"], ["Toph", "Try to think of something from your past that triggers your emotions."], ["Smellerbee", "The Fire Nation! Remember what they did to your family!"], ["Katara", "Close your eyes. Picture it."], ["Jet", "[Sweating.] No! It's too painful!"], ["Katara", "Maybe this will help. [Takes water and puts it around his ears, using healing to clear his mind.]"], ["Jet", "They took me to a headquarters under the water. Like a lake!"], ["Sokka", "Wait! Remember what Joo Dee said? She said she went on vacation to Lake Laogai!"], ["Jet", "[Stands up.] That's it!

I wonder who could be behind that mask ..."], ["Zuko", "[Sighs and takes off the mask.] What are you doing here?"], ["Iroh", "I was just about to ask you the same thing. What do you plan to do now that you've found the Avatar's bison? Keep him locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?"], ["Zuko", "First I have to get it out of here."], ["Iroh", "[Starts yelling.] And then what!? You never think these things through!

I have to do this!"], ["Iroh", "I'm begging you, Prince Zuko! It's time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions.

I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang."], ["Sokka", "I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different."], ["Katara", "Sokka, Long Feng is in control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful.

That whole thing is the palace! The Earth King's chamber should be in the center!"], ["Katara", "We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the king that we're coming."], ["Sokka", "Why would you assume that?

We're friends, Your Earthiness. [Gives a slight nervous chuckle.]"], ["Long Feng", "[Smiles sinisterly.] Detain the assailants!"], ["Sokka", "But we dropped our weapons.

[Looks at Katara and Sokka.] So, may I ask where we're going?"], ["Sokka", "Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place."], ["Toph", "It's gone!"], ["Sokka", "Oh don't tell me-\u00a0! [Gives a thumbs up and a fake smile.] That's okay.

I was a spiritual brother of your people, and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso."], ["Aang", "In your note, [Aang sits.] you said you could teach me how to gain control of the Avatar State. How?"], ["Pathik", "You must gain balance within yourself, before you can bring balance to the world. And the first step to gaining balance begins with this.

Aang, tell me everything you know about chakras."], ["Aang", "[Rubs eyes.] What are chakras?"], ["Pathik", "Oh, I see. I guess we'll start with the basics. [As he explains he points to the water and the moss within.] The water flows through this creek, much like the energy flows through your body. As you see, there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on. These pools are like our chakras."], ["Aang", "So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?"], ["Pathik", "Exactly. If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear. However, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek. And then what happens?"], ["Aang", "The creek can't flow?"], ["Pathik", "Yes. But, if we open the ponds between the pools ... [He removes moss blocking the exit for the water.]"], ["Aang", "The energy flows!"], ["Pathik", "There are seven chakras that go up the body. Each pool of energy has a purpose, and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck. Be warned, opening the chakras is an intense experience, and once you begin the process, you cannot stop until all seven are open. Are you ready?"], ["Aang", "[Momentarily looks down.] I'll do whatever it takes."], ["Pathik", "First we will open the Earth Chakra, located at the base of the spine. It deals with survival, and is blocked by fear. What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become clear to you."], ["Pathik", "Aang, your vision is not real. You are concerned for your survival, but you must surrender those fears. Let your fears flow down the creek. [Aang clears the image away.] You have opened your Earth Chakra! [Aang wipes sweat off his forehead.]"], ["Pathik", "Next is the ..."], ["Aang", "Water Chakra?"], ["Pathik", "Brilliant! Maybe one day you will be a guru too!

[Sees images of him in the Avatar State at General Fong's base.] I hurt all of those people."], ["Pathik", "Accept the reality that these things happened, but do not let them cloud and poison your energy. If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive yourself."], ["Hakoda", "This bay leads directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se.

Buoyant? And ... [Sniffs and immediately becomes disgusted.] Aggh, ehhh! Terrible smelling!"], ["Hakoda", "Very perceptive. The mines are filled with skunk fish and seaweed.

Moving on. This chakra deals with willpower, and is blocked by shame. What are you ashamed of?

I can't."], ["Pathik", "You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life. You are the Avatar and therefore, you are a firebender.

Pickles? [Pathik shrugs.]"], ["Mai", "[Sighs.] I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise. I don't know how anyone could fight in this."], ["Ty Lee", "Maybe that's why it was so easy to beat the Kyoshi Warriors and take their clothes."], ["Mai", "How much longer do we have to serve the Earth King?

I'm sure the Dai Li will deliver the message."], ["Pathik", "The fourth chakra is located in the heart. It deals with love and is blocked by grief.

[The airbenders appear floating in the clouds.] But love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around us.

[Aang wipes away his tears.] Very good."], ["Aang", "Can I have some onion-banana juice, please?"], ["Pathik", "The fifth in the chain is the Sound Chakra, located in the throat. It deals with truth and is blocked by lies. The ones we tell ourselves."], ["Katara", "Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?"], ["Aang", "Because I never wanted to be."], ["Pathik", "You cannot lie about your own nature. You must accept that you are the Avatar. [Aang inhales and, seeing an image of himself on a cliff looking down at the ground, exhales, and accepts his nature.] Very good, Aang. You have opened the chakra of truth."], ["Pathik", "The sixth pool of energy is the light chakra, located in the center of the forehead. It deals with insight and is blocked by illusion. The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation.

We are all one people, [The territories become separate again.] but we live as if divided."], ["Aang", "We're all connected. Everything is connected."], ["Pathik", "That's right! Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion. If you open your mind, you will see that all the elements are one. Four parts of the same whole.

I need two jasmine, one green, and one lychee!"], ["Iroh", "I'm brewing as fast as I can!"], ["Aang", "This is the last chakra, isn't it?"], ["Pathik", "Yes.

[He points above as camera zooms back to show four toucan puffins standing on a rock behind him.] Those are enemy birds."], ["Sokka", "Well, this is it. [Cut to Sokka standing in front of the other three.] This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins. [His head drops each time he says the word, \"cave\".] Hiding in cave after cave after cave after cave ..."], ["Katara", "[Cut to Katara, standing near Aang, from behind Sokka.] Sokka, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes."], ["Aang", "Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out. [Cut to Aang and Katara.] If we get Fire Nation disguises, [Smiling.] we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave."], ["Toph", "[Cut to Toph, who is sitting down with her legs slightly folded.] Plus, they have real food out there. Does anyone want to sit in the dirt and eat cave hoppers?"], ["Sokka", "Looks like we got outvoted, sport. Let's get some new clothes."], ["Aang", "[Whispering.] I don't know about this. [Cut to a view of Team Avatar from the clothes.] These clothes belong to somebody."], ["Katara", "I call the silk robe! [Jumps out from behind the rock wall and grabs two outfits.]"], ["Aang", "But if it's essential to our survival ... then I call the suit! [Jumps over the wall.]"], ["Aang", "[Puts on a headband.] Ta-dah! Normal kid."], ["Toph", "Hm ... I should probably wear shoes. But then I won't be able to see as well. [Sits down.] Sorry, shoes. [Pulls on the shoe, launching the sole at Sokka's face, leaving a red mark.] Finally, a stylish shoe for the blind earthbender."], ["Katara", "[Walks partially on camera.] How do I look? [The camera pans from Katara's dress to her whole outfit.]"], ["Aang", "[Blushing, scratching his head.] Uh ... your mom's necklace."], ["Katara", "Oh, [Touches necklace.] oh, yeah. I guess it's pretty obviously Water Tribe, isn't it? [Takes off the necklace and holds it in her hand.]"], ["Aang", "I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago. So, everyone just follow my lead and stay cool. Or, as they say in the Fire Nation, stay flamin'. [Walks around the building corner. To a man eating meat on a stick.] Greetings, my good hotman."], ["Fire Nation man", "[Confused.] Uh, hi. [Sokka shrugs at him as he passes.] I guess ..."], ["Aang", "[Looking at a meat display.] Oh, we're going to a meat place?"], ["Sokka", "Come on, Aang, everyone here eats meat. Even the meat. [Points at a hippo cow eating a piece of meat swarming with flies.]"], ["Aang", "You guys go ahead. I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage. [Aang and Katara wave each at each other as the rest enter. Turns around to greet random people on the street.] Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman."], ["Male soldier", "It's over. We caught you."], ["Aang", "[Guiltily.] Who, me?"], ["Male soldier", "It couldn't be more obvious that you don't belong here. [Cut to Aang looking very nervous.] Next time you play hooky, you might wanna take off your school uniform."], ["Kwan", "Oh. Is this a new mind ready for molding?"], ["Aang", "That's right. [Knocking on his head.] Let the molding begin. [The two guards turn away to leave.]"], ["Kwan", "Wait a minute. [The two guards turn back.] You're not from the Fire Nation. [Walks around Aang.] Clearly you're from the colonies."], ["Aang", "Yeah, the colonies, of course. The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom. [The two guards walk away.]"], ["Kwan", "Your etiquette is terrible. In the homeland, we bow to our elders. [Walks in front of her desk.] Like so. [Bows.]"], ["Aang", "Sorry, ma'am."], ["Kwan", "And we don't wear head coverings indoors."], ["Aang", "Um ... I have a scar. It's really embarrassing."], ["Kwan", "Very well. What is your name? Or should we just call you \"Mannerless Colony Slob\"?"], ["Aang", "[Chuckles.] Just \"slob\" is fine. Or, uh, Kuzon."], ["Aang", "We made it through the day Momo, and it was pretty fun."], ["On Ji", "[From behind Aang.] Don't let the headmaster catch you with that monkey. [The camera shifts to show her.]"], ["Aang", "[Turns around, trying to act innocent.] What monkey?"], ["On Ji", "Don't worry, I'm not a tattletale. My name's On Ji. I like your headband, by the way."], ["Hide", "[Walks past Aang, slightly bumping him away and puts a hand around On Ji's shoulders.] On Ji, you don't have to baby-sit the new kid."], ["Aang", "Wow. [Bows.] You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about."], ["Hide", "That's right. Now listen, friend. I know you're from the colonies, so I'll say this slowly. [Leans close to Aang, talking slowly.] On Ji is my girlfriend. [Pokes Aang's chest.] Don't forget it."], ["Aang", "[Waving goodbye to On Ji and Hide.] It was nice meeting you."], ["Shoji", "[Approaches Aang.] I don't believe it, he didn't beat you up. Not even a little."], ["Aang", "I guess I'm just lucky."], ["Shoji", "We were on our way to play hide and explode. You wanna come?"], ["Aang", "I'd love to."], ["Katara", "[Concernedly.] Where have you been? We've been worried sick."], ["Aang", "[Undoing his headband.] I got invited to play with some kids after school."], ["Sokka", "[Springs up to his feet in shock.] After what?!"], ["Aang", "I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow."], ["Sokka", "[With an exasperated facial expression.] Enrolled in what?! [Falls backward in disbelief.]"], ["Guard", "[Readies his spear, with it pointed directly at Zuko.] You again? Stop where you are! [Zuko raises his head, looking at the guard.] Prince Zuko ..."], ["Zuko", "I'm going in for a visit. You're going to stand guard here, and no one is going to know about this. [Zuko releases the guard, enters Iroh's cell, and approaches him.] Uncle, it's me. [Iroh, sitting on the floor, turns away from Zuko with a scowl on his face.]"], ["Sokka", "Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea, but it sounds ... really terrible."], ["Toph", "Yeah, we got our outfits. What do you need to go to school for?"], ["Aang", "Every minute I'm in that classroom, I'm learning new things about the Fire Nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai. [Holds up the picture.] And here's one that I made out of noodles! [Holds up his picture of Ozai.]"], ["Sokka", "Impressive, I admit, but I still think it's too dangerous."], ["Aang", "I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow."], ["Sokka", "Hmm, I am a fan of secret rivers ... fine, let's stay a few more days."], ["Aang", "Flamey-o, hotman! [Runs off.]"], ["Sokka", "[To Katara.] Flamey-o?"], ["Zuko", "You brought this on yourself you know. We could have returned together. You could have been a hero! [Iroh shifts but does not look at him.] You have no right to judge me, Uncle. I did what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you're a fool for not joining me. [Iroh continues ignoring him.] You're not going to say anything? [Kicks up a small stool and destroys it with firebending.] You're a crazy old man! You're crazy! And if you weren't in jail, you'd be sleeping in a gutter! [Zuko leaves, slamming the door behind him as Iroh's head drops slightly and he closes his eyes.]"], ["Kwan", "Good morning class. Recite the Fire Nation oath. [Sits down at her desk.]"], ["Class", "[Turns to a large painting of Ozai at the back of the class.] My life I give to my country, with my hands I fight for Fire Lord Ozai and our forefathers before him."], ["Aang", "[Glances around the room as the class recites the oath.] Fire Lord ... forefathers ..."], ["Class", "With my mind I seek ways to better my country, and with my feet may our March of Civilization continue."], ["Aang", "Firebenders ... Fire Lord ... wah, bah, blah, blah. [The class snickers at him as they sit down as the teacher looks on with a stern expression.]"], ["Kwan", "Since it's obviously hilarious to mock our national oath, we'll begin with a pop quiz on our great March of Civilization. [The class groans and picks up their pens.] Question one: What year did Fire Lord Sozin battle the Air Nation army? [Aang raises his hand.] Kuzon?"], ["Aang", "Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush. [The entire class stares at him, dumbfounded.]"], ["Kwan", "Well, I don't know how you could possibly know more than our national history book. Unless you were there a hundred years ago."], ["Aang", "I'll just write down my best guess."], ["Music teacher", "Kuzon?"], ["Aang", "[Stopping.] I know, I'm a terrible tsungi hornist."], ["Music teacher", "No, child. That hullabaloo going on with your feet. Is that a nervous disorder?"], ["Aang", "I was just dancing. You do dances here in the homeland, right?"], ["Shoji", "Not really, no."], ["Music teacher", "Dancing is not conducive to a proper learning environment. Young people must have rigid discipline and order."], ["Aang", "But what about expressing yourself?"], ["Music teacher", "I know sometimes we're so ruled by our love for our nation that we can't control our own bodies. [He puts his hand to his face at what he is saying before continuing on.] If you must, you may march in place quietly next time the urge hits you."], ["On Ji", "[Waves at Aang.] Uh, hi, Kuzon. I really liked that crazy dance you were doing."], ["Aang", "Thanks On Ji. I could show it to you again if you like. Ah! [He jumps as a blast of fire hits the ground at his feet.]"], ["Hide", "What'd you say, colony trash? You're gonna show her something?"], ["Aang", "[Nervously.] Just some dance movements."], ["Hide", "Nobody shows my On Ji anything, especially movements!"], ["Headmaster", "[Angrily.] Picking fights on your second day? We need to have a conference to discuss your punishment. Bring your parents to my office after school."], ["Aang", "[Worriedly.] Parents? But-"], ["Headmaster", "Don't be late!"], ["Headmaster", "Thank you for coming, Mr. and Mrs ... [Shot changes to show Sokka and Katara in disguise with Aang sitting between them.]"], ["Sokka", "Fire. Wang Fire. [Pointing to Katara.] This is my wife, Sapphire."], ["Katara", "Sapphire Fire. Nice to meet you."], ["Headmaster", "Mr. and Mrs ... Fire, your son has been enrolled here for two days and he's already causing problems. He's argued with his history teacher, disrupted music class, and roughed up my star pupil."], ["Katara", "My goodness! That doesn't sound like our Kuzon."], ["Headmaster", "That's what any mother would say, Ma'am. Nonetheless, you're forewarned; if he acts up one more time, I'll have him sent to reform school- [Stands up.] by which I mean the coal mines. Are we clear?"], ["Sokka", "Don't you worry, Mr. Headmaster. I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce! [Turns to Aang.] Young man, as soon as we get home you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime!

[They kiss, but are interrupted by Azula.]"], ["Azula", "Ahem. [They turn to look at her, clearly annoyed.] Zuko, could I have a word with you?"], ["Zuko", "Can't you see we're busy? [They kiss again.]"], ["Azula", "Oh Mai, Ty Lee need your help untangling her braid."], ["Mai", "[Stands up.] Sounds pretty serious. [Leaves, but throws an angry glance at Azula behind her back.]"], ["Azula", "So, I've heard you've been to visit your uncle fatso in the prison tower."], ["Zuko", "[Standing angrily.] That guard told you."], ["Azula", "No. You did. Just now."], ["Zuko", "[Sits back down.] Okay, you caught me. What is it that you want Azula?"], ["Azula", "Actually, nothing. Believe it or not, I'm looking out for you. If people find out you've been to see Uncle, they'll think you're plotting with him. Just be careful, Dum-Dum."], ["Sokka", "[Frontal shot.] That settles it! No more school for you, young man! [Strokes his beard.]"], ["Aang", "I'm not ready to leave yet. I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid. You don't know what it's like, Sokka. You get to be normal all the time."], ["Toph", "Ha ha! [Sokka glares at her.]"], ["Aang", "Listen guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation. If we want to change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom."], ["Sokka", "What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?"], ["Aang", "I'm gonna throw them, [Starts dancing.] a secret dance party! [Everybody stares at Aang.]"], ["Sokka", "[In Wang Fire voice.] Go to your room!"], ["Sokka", "[Placing a candle.] I can't believe we're having a dance party. It seems so ... silly."], ["Aang", "Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork! [Dances.]"], ["Toph", "[Feeling their approach.] They're coming! Everyone stop bending."], ["Aang", "[To Appa.] Sorry buddy, you should probably wait out back. [Appa grumbles as Aang herds him into the back.] I know, you got fancier feet than anybody. And six of 'em!"], ["Aang", "[Jumps in front of the stage.] Ladies and gentlemen, the Flamey-O's! Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving.

What if someone finds out?! [Looks around nervously before exiting left.]"], ["Aang", "Oh boy. Listen guys, dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you."], ["Shoji", "Maybe it was different in the colonies, Kuzon, but we don't do that here."], ["Aang", "Sure you do, you have for generations! It just so happens that I know several classic Fire Nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as the 'Phoenix Flight'. [The students ooh and aah as Aang runs low to the ground.] And, this was the 'Camelephant Strut'."], ["Toph", "[To Katara.] Who knew Twinkle Toes could dance?"], ["Zuko", "[Sliding food into Iroh's cell as Iroh keeps his back to him.] I brought you some komodo chicken. I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food. I admit it, I have everything I always wanted, but it's not as all how I thought it would be. The truth is, I need your advice. [Grips the bars.] I think the Avatar is still alive, I know he's out there, I'm losing my mind. [Desperately.] Please, Uncle, I'm so confused I need your help.

[She looks back surreptitiously.]"], ["Aang", "Yeah, that's it! That's the sound of happy feet. [The rest of the kids start dancing with them.] All right, go with that! Everybody freestyle!"], ["Katara", "[Looks away nervously.] I don't know, Aang. These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I-I'm not sure that I know how to-"], ["Aang", "[Smiling.] Take my hand."], ["Katara", "[Smiles back'.] Okay."], ["Katara", "Aang, everyone's watching."], ["Aang", "Don't worry about them. It's just you and me right now."], ["Headmaster", "It is a dancing party.

It's like my inhibitions just disappear! [He sees the Headmaster come into the cave, and immediately stops dancing and attempts to shrink into his robes.] Okay, they're back again."], ["Headmaster", "[Pointing.] He's the one we want! The boy with the headband!"], ["Aang", "Uh-oh. [Aang starts running away through the crowd as the soldiers chase him. One soldier sees a boy with a headband, and grabs him.]"], ["Male soldier #1", "Gotcha! [The boy turns, but the guard is confused upon seeing a different boy there.]"], ["Shoji", "Looking for me?"], ["Headmaster", "That's not the one. He's here somewhere. Don't let him leave the cave!"], ["On Ji", "Yes?"], ["Male student #2", "[Picking his nose.] Hi there."], ["Male student #1", "How're we doing?"], ["Female student #1", "Looking for someone?"], ["On Ji", "Who are you looking for?"], ["Female Student #1", "Do you need something?"], ["Student", "Over here."], ["Headmaster", "[To one of the soldiers, who starts dancing.] Stop that! [To another soldier, who is tapping her foot.] Stop that!"], ["Katara", "We're safe Sokka, you can take off the mustache now."], ["Sokka", "[He is seen with his Wang Fire mustache on and begins stroking it.] Oh, no I can't. It's permanently glued to my skin."], ["Toph", "[To Aang.] Way to go, dancy pants. I think you really did help those kids, you taught them to be free."], ["Aang", "I don't know, it was just a dance party, that's all."], ["Katara", "Well, that was some dance party Aang.

Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone. You should be down on your knees thanking her!"], ["Katara", "Sokka, it's okay. [She steps forward and moves Sokka back. To the villagers.] I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you. But I felt like I had to do something. It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not. Because your problems are real, and this river is real. You can't wait around for someone to help you.

Together, we could do ... anything."], ["Roku", "[The camera pans toward Roku. Now serious.] Yeah, we could."], ["Sozin", "[Cut to a shot of the Fire Nation from the balcony.] Our nation is enjoying an unprecedented time of peace and wealth.

Oooh ... It came into the torchlight ... and they knew the blade of Wing Fung was haunted! [Draws sword, stands up and points it toward the fire; yells dramatically.] Ooh-aaah!"], ["Aang", "[Unimpressed.] I think I like \"the man with a sword for a hand\" better."], ["Toph", "Water Tribe slumber parties must stink."], ["Katara", "No, wait! I've got one! And this is a true Southern Water Tribe story."], ["Sokka", "[Sitting down.] Is this one of those \"a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to\" stories?"], ["Katara", "No, it happened to Mom."], ["Katara", "One winter when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So Mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home. [Cuts to ground-level shot of the group sitting around the fire, the camera panning slightly to the right.] Just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice. [In a scary voice.] \"It's so cold and I can't get warm!\" [Sokka stiffens in fear.] Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone."], ["Sokka", "[Peering from behind a tree trunk.] Where'd she go?"], ["Katara", "No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm."], ["Toph", "[Gasping.] Wait! Guys, did you hear that? [Aang, Katara, and Sokka clutch each other tightly, too stiff to move, with Toph standing alertly.] I hear people under the mountain. And they're screaming."], ["Sokka", "Pft! Nice try, Toph."], ["Toph", "[Cuts to shot of the campsite viewed through the ominous looking tree branches.] No, I'm serious. I hear something."], ["Katara", "You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories ..."], ["Toph", "It just ... stopped."], ["Aang", "[Cuts back to him and Katara, still hugging, Sokka sitting close by.] All right, now I'm getting scared."], ["Hama", "[Off-camera from behind group.] Hello, children."], ["Hama", "Sorry to frighten you. My name is Hama. [Cuts to side-view of the campsite.] You children shouldn't be out in the forest by yourselves at night. [Cuts to ground-level shot of Hama standing over the fire.] I have an inn nearby. Why don't you come back there for some spiced tea and warm beds?"], ["Sokka", "[Sheepishly, places arm behind head.] Yes, please."], ["Katara", "Thanks for letting us stay here tonight. You have a lovely inn."], ["Hama", "[Sets teapot down.] Aren't you sweet? [Walks over to her seat and sits down.] You know you should be careful. People have been disappearing in those woods you were camping in."], ["Sokka", "What do you mean \"disappearing\"?"], ["Hama", "[Sets her teacup down.] When the moon turns full, people walk in and they don't come out. [Stand up and holds up her teapot; cheerfully smiling.] Who wants more tea?"], ["Hama", "Don't worry, you'll all be completely safe here. [Clasps hands together and smiles.] Why don't I show you to your rooms and you can get a good night's rest?"], ["Sokka", "I know, Momo. [Places sword back inside holster and sets it down.] This place is creepy! [Lies back down on the pillow and pulls the covers over him.] I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep!"], ["Hama", "[Off-camera.] Wakey, wakey! [Cuts to shot of the innkeeper, standing brightly over him.] Time to go shopping!"], ["Katara", "That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages?"], ["Hama", "[Seriously.] You would have me use my feminine charms to take advantage of that poor man? [Cheerfully.] I think you and I are going to get along swimmingly!"], ["Villager", "You won't have any ash bananas till next week?"], ["Shop owner", "Well, I have to send the boy to Hing Wa Island to get them, and it's a two-day trip."], ["Villager", "Oh, right. Tomorrow's the full moon."], ["Shop owner", "[In a lowered voice.] Exactly. I can't lose another delivery boy in the woods."], ["Sokka", "People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff happening during full moons? This just reeks of Spirit World shenanigans."], ["Aang", "I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad."], ["Sokka", "[Makes gesture with his hand.] And then you can sew up this little mystery lickety-split, Avatar style!"], ["Aang", "[Proudly.] Helping people ... that's what I do."], ["Hama", "Why don't you take all those things back to the inn? I just have to run a couple more errands. I'll be back in a little while."], ["Sokka", "[Walks up to her.] This is a mysterious little town you have here."], ["Hama", "[Extremely close-up. Ominously.] Mysterious town for mysterious children."], ["Sokka", "That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something."], ["Katara", "[Unpacking items.] That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. [Picks up cabbage.] She kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran."], ["Sokka", "But what did she mean by that comment, \"mysterious children\"?"], ["Katara", "Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?"], ["Sokka", "I'm gonna take a look around. [Walks away and up a flight of wooden stairs.]"], ["Katara", "[Appears along with the others at the bottom of the stairwell.] Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing? [Off-camera as Sokka peers around the inn.] You can't just snoop around someone's house."], ["Sokka", "It'll be fine."], ["Aang", "[Off-camera while Sokka peers into a room.] She could be home any minute."], ["Katara", "[Walking down hallway with the rest of the team.] Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble and this is just plain rude!"], ["Sokka", "[Tugging on a cupboard door.] I'm not finished yet. [Grunts, as he tries to pull it free.] Come on ..."], ["Aang", "Okay, that's pretty creepy."], ["Katara", "[Walks over and closes the cupboard; a bit weirded out.] So she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that. [Angrily.] Sokka, you've looked enough. [Off-camera as Sokka ascends into the attic.] Hama will be back soon."], ["Sokka", "Just an ordinary puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Well then why does she have a locked door up here?"], ["Katara", "[Annoyed.] Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff!"], ["Sokka", "We'll see. [Peers through the keyhole into the room. Cuts to shot of the attic from his perspective. Through the keyhole, a small room can be seen, with a chest lying on the ground in the middle. The camera zooms in on the chest.] It's empty, except for a little chest."], ["Toph", "Maybe it's treasure!"], ["Katara", "[Approaches him.] Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room!"], ["Sokka", "I have to see what's in there."], ["Aang", "We shouldn't be doing this."], ["Sokka", "Maybe there's a key here somewhere ..."], ["Toph", "Ooh! Hand it over!"], ["Sokka", "[Eagerly.] Come on, come on!"], ["Toph", "[Annoyed; Katara appears from behind her, peering nervously over her shoulder.] This isn't as easy as it looks!"], ["Aang", "[Nervously.] Guys, I don't know about this ..."], ["Katara", "This is crazy! I'm leaving!"], ["Sokka", "Suit yourself! Do it, Toph!"], ["Hama", "[Off-camera from behind them.] I'll tell you what's in the box."], ["Sokka", "[Surprised.] An old comb?"], ["Hama", "It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I own from growing up in the Southern Water Tribe."], ["Katara", "[Stunned.] You're from the Southern Water Tribe?"], ["Hama", "[Sets down comb.] Just like you."], ["Katara", "How did you know?"], ["Hama", "I heard you talking around your campfire."], ["Sokka", "But why didn't you tell us?"], ["Hama", "I wanted to surprise you! I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big Water Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes if you stew them long enough."], ["Aang", "[Sticking his tongue out in disgust.] Great ..."], ["Katara", "I knew I felt a bond with you right away."], ["Sokka", "And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right. [Grimaces as Katara hits him in the arm.] But I'm sorry we were sneaking around."], ["Hama", "Apology accepted. [Turns to the side and motions with her hand.] Now, let's get cooking!"], ["Aang", "[Whispering to Toph.] I'd steer clear of the sea prunes."], ["Toph", "I thought they were ocean kumquats."], ["Aang", "Close enough."], ["Hama", "Who wants five flavor soup?"], ["Katara", "[Delighted.] You're a waterbender! [Faces Hama in delight.] I've never met another waterbender from our tribe!"], ["Hama", "[Cuts to side-view of her; sadly.] That's because the Fire Nation wiped them all out. I was the last one ..."], ["Sokka", "So how did you end up out here?"], ["Hama", "[Grimly.] I was stolen from my home."], ["Hama", "[Voice-over.] It was over sixty years ago when the raids started."], ["Hama", "[Voice-over.] They came again and again, each time rounding up more of our waterbenders and taking them captive."], ["Hama", "[Voice-over.] We did our best to hold them off, but our numbers dwindled as the raids continued."], ["Hama", "[Voice-over.] Finally, I too was captured."], ["Hama", "[Voice-over.] I was led away in chains. The last waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe."], ["Hama", "They put us in terrible prisons here in the Fire Nation. I was the only one who managed to escape."], ["Sokka", "How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?"], ["Hama", "I'm sorry. It's too painful to talk about anymore."], ["Katara", "We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid."], ["Hama", "[Sympathetically.] Oh, you poor things."], ["Katara", "I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor. You're a hero."], ["Hama", "I never thought I'd meet another Southern waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know so you can carry on the Southern tradition when I'm gone."], ["Katara", "Yes! Yes, of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me."], ["Hama", "Growing up in the South Pole, waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow and ice and seas. But as you probably noticed on your travels, that isn't the case wherever you go."], ["Katara", "I know! When we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do."], ["Hama", "[Stops walking.] That's why you have to learn to control water wherever it exists."], ["Katara", "I've even used my own sweat for waterbending."], ["Hama", "[Smiling.] That's very resourceful, Katara. You're thinking like a true master. But did you know you could even pull water out of thin air?"], ["Hama", "You have got to keep an open mind, Katara. [The water around her fingertips freezes, creating ice claws.] There's water in places you never think about."], ["Aang", "This has got to be the nicest natural setting in the Fire Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here."], ["Toph", "Maybe the Moon Spirit just turned mean."], ["Sokka", "[Angrily.] The Moon Spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and ... lunar goodness!"], ["Aang", "[Catches sight of a villager walking past.] Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people?"], ["Villager", "Only one man ever saw it and lived and that's Old Man Ding."], ["Toph", "Where does Old Man Ding live?"], ["Katara", "Wow, these flowers are beautiful."], ["Hama", "They're called fire lilies. They only bloom a few weeks a year, but they're one of my favorite things about living here. And like all plants and all living things, they're filled with water."], ["Katara", "I met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside."], ["Hama", "You can take it even further."], ["Katara", "That was incredible! [Sees the wilted lilies.] It's a shame about the lilies, though."], ["Hama", "They're just flowers. When you're a waterbender in a strange land, you do what you must to survive. Tonight I'll teach you the ultimate technique of waterbending. It can only be done during the full moon, when your bending is at its peak."], ["Katara", "[Cautiously.] But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon."], ["Hama", "Oh, Katara. Two master waterbenders beneath a full moon? [Begins walking away.] I don't think we have anything to worry about."], ["Aang", "Old Man Ding?"], ["Ding", "Huh? [Accidentally hammers his thumb.] Ow, dang blame it! What? Can't you see I'm busy? Got a full moon rising. And why does everyone call me that? I'm not that old! [Attempts to lift a wooden plank off the ground, but fails to do so. Sighs.] Well, I'm young at heart."], ["Ding", "Not ready to get snapped up by some moon monster yet at least."], ["Sokka", "[Proceeds to nail the board to the window frame.] We wanted to ask you about that."], ["Aang", "Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you?"], ["Ding", "Didn't see no spirit, just felt something come over me, like I was possessed. Forced me to start walking toward the mountain. [Points to the mountain.] I tried to fight it, but I couldn't control my own limbs. It just about had me into a cave up there. [Imitates a walking puppet.] And I looked up at the moon for what I thought would be my last glimpse of light. [Cuts to shot of the trio, Sokka quivering in fear.] But then the sun started to rise and I got control of myself again! I just high-tailed it away from that mountain as quick as I could!"], ["Sokka", "Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?"], ["Toph", "Oh no! [Sokka and Aang assume defensive positions.] I did hear people screaming under the mountain. The missing villagers must still be there!"], ["Toph", "[Feels the ground with her hand.] I can hear them. They're this way!"], ["Hama", "Can you feel the power the full moon brings?"], ["Hama", "For generations it has blessed waterbenders with its glow, allowing us to do incredible things!"], ["Hama", "[Extreme close-up; in a sinister tone.] I've never felt more alive."], ["Toph", "This is the place."], ["Sokka", "I can't see anything down there."], ["Toph", "[Grabs Sokka's hand.] That's why you have me. Let's go!"], ["Male prisoner #1", "We're saved!"], ["Aang", "I didn't know spirits made prisons like this. Who brought you here?"], ["Female prisoner", "It was no spirit."], ["Male prisoner #2", "It was a witch!"], ["Sokka", "A witch? What do you mean?"], ["Female prisoner", "[Speaking, as Toph unlocks her shackles.] She seems like a normal old woman, but she controls people like some dark puppetmaster!"], ["Sokka", "[Gritting.] Hama!"], ["Male prisoner #1", "Yes, the innkeeper!"], ["Sokka", "I knew there was something creepy about her!"], ["Aang", "We have to stop Hama!"], ["Toph", "I'll get these people out of here. You go!"], ["Hama", "What I'm about to show you, [Cuts to close-up of Hama glaring menacingly.] I discovered in that wretched Fire Nation prison."], ["Hama", "[Voice-over.] The guards were always very careful to keep any water away from us. They piped in dry air and had us suspended away from the ground. Before giving us any water, they would bind our hands and feet so we couldn't bend. [A side-view is shown of Fire Nation guards giving water to a tied up prisoner.] Any sign of trouble was met with cruel retribution. [Cuts to shot of the full moon in the sky during present day.] And yet each month, I felt the full moon enriching me with its energy. [Cuts to shot of Hama.] There had to be something I could do to escape. [Scene fades to flashback of the prison.] Then I realized that where there is life, there is water. [A younger Hama is shown bending the water inside an elephant rat that had wandered its way into her cage.] The rats that scurried across the floor of my cage were nothing more than skins filled with liquid and I passed years developing the skill that would lead to my escape. [A close-up is shown of Hama smiling at her discovery. The scene fades back to present day. Ominously.] Bloodbending. [Cut to a scared Katara.] Controlling the water in another body, [Cut to ground shot of both Hama and Katara.] enforcing your own will over theirs. [The scene fades back to a flashback of young Hama controlling a horde of rats using bloodbending.] Once I had mastered the rats, I was ready for the men."], ["Hama", "[Voice-over.] And during the next full moon, I walked free for the first time in decades. [The guard attempts to get up, but Hama quickly forces him back down to the ground. She walks unsteadily away.] My cell unlocked by the very guards assigned to keep me in. [Scene changes back to present day; camera focuses on a close-up of Hama.] Once you perfect this technique, you can control anything or [Looks at Katara from the corner of her eyes sadistically.] anyone."], ["Katara", "[Unsure.] But ... to reach inside someone and control them? [Casts unsure glance off to the side.] I don't know if I want that kind of power."], ["Hama", "[Camera zooms out to the two standing in the forest.] The choice is not yours. The power exists. And it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war. [Closes up to Hama.] Katara, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture, your mother!"], ["Katara", "[Close-up of her face.] I know."], ["Hama", "[Camera changes back to Hama.] Then you should understand what I'm talking about! We're the last two waterbenders of the Southern Tribe. [Camera focuses on Katara; off-camera.] We have to fight these people whenever we can, wherever they are, with any means necessary!"], ["Katara", "[Widens eyes in realization.] It's you ... [Angrily.] You're the one who's been making people disappear during the full moons!"], ["Hama", "[Close-up of her face, as she tilts her head downward.] They threw me in prison to rot, along with my brothers and sisters! They deserve the same! You must carry on my work!"], ["Katara", "[Points to Hama, stretching out her left hand.] I won't! I won't use bloodbending and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town! [Her hand suddenly twists to one side. She tries desperately to stop it, but fails to do so.]"], ["Hama", "[Now using bloodbending to subdue to her.] You should've learned the technique before you turned against me! [Forces Katara into a strained position.] It's impossible to fight your way out of my grip! I control every muscle, every vein in your body!"], ["Katara", "[Tearfully.] Stop! Please ..."], ["Katara", "[Determined.] You're not the only one who draws power from the moon! [Assumes a fighting stance.] My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me!"], ["Hama", "[Shouts.] Aahhh!"], ["Sokka", "We know what you've been doing, Hama!"], ["Aang", "Give up! [Takes a fighting stance.] You're outnumbered!"], ["Hama", "No! [Rising.] You've outnumbered yourselves."], ["Sokka", "[Unwillingly draws his sword.] Katara, look out! [Forced to walk like a puppet, while waving the blade back and forth rapidly.] It's like my brain has a mind of its own! Stop it arm, stop it!"], ["Aang", "This feels weird!"], ["Katara", "[Using waterbending to freeze him to a nearby tree.] I'm sorry, Aang!"], ["Aang", "It's okay!"], ["Hama", "[Sinisterly.] Don't hurt your friends, Katara! And don't let them hurt each other!"], ["Katara", "[Horrified.] No!"], ["Male prisoner #1", "You're going to be locked away forever."], ["Hama", "My work is done.

[Zuko turns his head slightly.] Ordering some servants around. I might be hungry for a whole tray of fruit tarts. And maybe a little palanquin ride around town. Double time."], ["Aang", "Thanks for everything, guys."], ["Katara", "So, do you feel less stressed? Ready for a good night's sleep?"], ["Aang", "[He turns his head away.] Uh, I kinda think I sorta might slightly feel a little better. [He looks back at his friends.] Maybe."], ["Sokka", "Then our work here is done."], ["Katara", "What happened, Aang?"], ["Aang", "[Turns away on hands and knees.] It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse."], ["Sokka", "Looks like it's time for another ... [He turns around and puts his Wang Fire disguise on and voice.] therapy session."], ["Aang", "[Momentarily looking back.] No. That won't help. Nothing helps. There's only one thing I can do! I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion!"], ["Aang", "Invasion. All aboard for the invasion."], ["Katara", "[Approaching.] You don't look so good. You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap?"], ["Aang", "I told you, I can't go back to sleep."], ["Katara", "Aang, staying up all night can't be good for you."], ["Aang", "[Walking toward the cliff edge. Katara turns and moves a bit to follow.] Actually, staying up all night has given me some time to think. And I've realized some big things, Katara."], ["Katara", "What big things?"], ["Aang", "I see everything so clearly now. What really matters. Why I'm really doing this. [He turns around to look at Katara.] I'm doing it to save the world. But more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love. [Side shot of Aang and Katara near each other.] I'm doing it for you, Katara."], ["Katara", "Aang, what are you saying?"], ["Aang", "I'm saying, I love you! [He kisses her. After he pulls back, she embraces and kisses him back.]"], ["Katara", "[After kissing for a while she pulls back, whispering slightly.] What are we doing?"], ["Aang", "What our hearts have been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby, [He moves Katara down to the side.] you're my forever girl. [Aang puckers up his lips for another kiss.]"], ["Katara", "Aang! [Aang realizes he was just daydreaming, and realizes he is not holding Katara anymore.] I was just saying you should take a nap."], ["Aang", "[He quickly turns around to face Katara.] Oh, I guess I kinda drifted off into a daydream."], ["Katara", "What was your dream about?"], ["Aang", "[He pauses to think for a moment.] Uh, living underwater?"], ["Katara", "[Initially confused, she smiles back.] Sounds neat!"], ["Servant", "Prince Zuko, [He bows before the prince.] everyone's waiting for you."], ["Zuko", "What?"], ["Servant", "The high admirals, the high generals, the war ministers, and the princess have all arrived. You're the only person missing."], ["Zuko", "So, my dad wants me at the meeting?"], ["Servant", "The Fire Lord said he would not start until you arrived, sir."], ["Aang", "Put 'em up, Fire Lord!"], ["Sokka", "Hey! I'm tryin' build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked. He's your bison."], ["Aang", "[Standing in front of the \"Ozai\" tree in a fighting stance.] Ozai's defense is impeccable. I'll have to try a different approach."], ["Aang", "You think you're untouchable, don't you, Mr. Fire Lord?"], ["Momo", "[Off-screen.] Boy, you are really starting to lose it, kid."], ["Aang", "Momo, did you hear something? [Turns back.]"], ["Momo", "[Off-screen.] No, but I said something. [Aang becomes shocked and gets close to Momo.] You, my friend, are just a few plums short of a fruit pie. [Aang stares at Momo in disbelief, his jaw wide open. He quickly stands up, shakes his head, and covers his eyes. He peeks through them, at which point Momo begins chittering normally again. Aang walks up to him and pets him.]"], ["Aang", "That's more like it. I'm so tired that for a second there, I imagined you were talking to me. [Momo tilts his head in confusion. Everyone is seen walking forward and watching Aang.] Oh, Momo, let me explain. [Aang begins chattering like Momo. Katara and Sokka share a look of confusion, as Toph merely stands there with a slightly annoyed look. Momo chitters back, in which Aang laughs before chittering again. Katara interrupts him.]"], ["Katara", "Aang? We're all starting to get a little worried about you."], ["Sokka", "You've been awake too long."], ["Toph", "And you're acting downright weird."], ["Appa", "You've got to take care of yourself. You can't go on like this."], ["Aang", "[Sighs.] Look, I appreciate what you guys are saying, but the stress and the nightmares. They were just too much. Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it."], ["Momo", "[Standing and pointing at Appa.] Yeah! Leave the kid alone!"], ["Appa", "[Pointing back.] Hey, who asked you? [The two begin to fight.]"], ["Aang", "You guys, come on."], ["Appa", "No! I am sick of this guy always mouthing me and telling me what to do!"], ["Momo", "Oh, you don't like it?

Yay!"], ["Aang", "I just need to jump in a cold waterfall!"], ["Mai", "So, how did it go? [They walk on together.]"], ["Zuko", "When I got to the meeting, everyone welcomed me. My father had saved me a seat. He wanted me next to him. I was literally at his right hand."], ["Mai", "Zuko, that's wonderful! You must be happy."], ["Zuko", "During the meeting, I was the perfect prince. The son my father wanted. [Looks down, eyes closed.] But I wasn't me."], ["Aang", "Oh, look. Another hallucination. An imaginary bed made out of clouds."], ["Toph", "Hey! It's real! We spent hours working on it."], ["Sokka", "We made it for you. A good night's sleep will probably take the crazy away. We hope."], ["Aang", "Look! You guys keep telling me that I need to sleep, but I can't! The invasion's tomorrow!"], ["Katara", "[Concerned.] Aang ..."], ["Aang", "No, Katara! There's still so much I haven't learned. I don't need sleep. What I need is practice. Quick, hit me! [He begins to wobble.]"], ["Katara", "I'm not going to hit you."], ["Toph", "You want me to do it?

You can do this. You're ready."], ["Toph", "You're the man, Twinkle Toes!"], ["Aang", "Thanks, guys. [He nods, yawns, and rubs his eyes. Katara aids him to the bed, where he lies down.] You know what? I think I am ready. [The other three watch as he falls asleep quickly. He falls into another dream, meeting with Ozai again.] Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord!"], ["Ozai", "Really? You're gonna take me out?

Unfortunately there is one problem I couldn't fix. [Cut to outside of submarine as the submarines swim past, along with Aang on Appa.] The subs have a limited air supply.

It's our only chance."], ["Sokka", "I've got an idea."], ["Hakoda", "You two take out that battlement. [Pointing to a battlement in the distance before leaving to another.] I got this one. Watch each other's backs. [Cut to Sokka and Katara, shown breaking into their battlement, Katara freezing the soldiers inside. Sokka uses his sword to cut through the launcher, causing part of it to fall out and explode outside as Katara and Sokka exit the battlement. They see Hakoda on the roof of his as he climbs inside.

[Cuts to shot of him.] This should be interesting."], ["Zuko", "First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me."], ["Ozai", "Why would she lie to me about that?"], ["Zuko", "Because the Avatar's not dead. He survived."], ["Ozai", "[Shocked and horrified.] What?"], ["Zuko", "In fact, he's probably leading this invasion. He could be on his way here right now."], ["Ozai", "[Rises from his seat and points toward the door.] Get out! Get out of my sight right now if you know what's good for you!"], ["Zuko", "That's another thing. I'm not taking orders from you anymore."], ["Ozai", "[Angrily.] You will obey me, or this defiant breath will be your last!"], ["Zuko", "[Pulls out his swords.] Think again. I am going to speak my mind, and you are going to listen."], ["Aang", "Where is he? Where's the Fire Lord?"], ["Azula", "[Rises from throne.] You mean I'm not good enough for you? [Acts hurt.] You're hurting my feelings."], ["Sokka", "Stop wasting our time and give us the information. [Points sword at her.] You're powerless right now, so you're in no position to refuse."], ["Toph", "[Appears on scene and clenches fist.] And stick to the truth. I'll be able to tell if you're lying."], ["Azula", "[Walking a few steps forward.] Are you sure? I'm a pretty good liar. [Pauses slightly.] I am a four-hundred foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings."], ["Toph", "[Cuts to Toph; short pause.] Okay, you're good, I admit it. [Traps Azula using earthbending.] But you ought to consider telling the truth anyway!"], ["Azula", "[Brushing off dust.] When I left Ba Sing Se I brought home some souvenirs: Dai Li agents!"], ["Bato", "Surround the periphery! [Raises spear.] We have to secure the palace by the time the eclipse is over! Otherwise, we'll be in for the fight of our lives."], ["Tyro", "Stop! Surrender peacefully and we won't harm you."], ["Fire Nation soldier", "We'll never surrender! [Makes frenzied motions and tries to firebend, but cannot.] Okay, we surrender. [Fire Nation soldiers back down.]"], ["Hakoda", "[Happily.] There it is: the Fire Nation Royal Palace. We've come so far."], ["Katara", "[Doubtful.] It's not over yet."], ["Zuko", "For so long, all I wanted was for you to love me, to accept me. I thought it was my honor I wanted, but really, I was just trying to please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn. [Points a broadsword at his father.] My father, who challenged me, a thirteen-year-old boy, to an Agni Kai. [Cuts to shot of Ozai, looking angered.] How could you possibly justify a duel with a child?"], ["Ozai", "[Scornful.] It was to teach you respect!"], ["Zuko", "It was cruel! And it was wrong."], ["Ozai", "[Angrily.] Then you have learned nothing!"], ["Zuko", "No, I've learned everything! And I've had to learn it on my own! Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow, the War was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation. They don't see our greatness. They hate us! And we deserve it! [Camera view shows top profile of Zuko and Ozai through an overhead grate.] We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself [Cuts to shot of Zuko.], we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness."], ["Ozai", "[Laughs.] Your uncle has gotten to you, hasn't he?"], ["Zuko", "Yes. [Smiles proudly.] He has."], ["Aang", "[While running.] I can't pin her down! She's too quick!"], ["Sokka", "[Stops running.] Wait! Aang! Toph! Stop attacking! Don't you see what she's doing? She's just playing with us. She's not even trying to win this fight!"], ["Azula", "[Calmly.] Not true. I'm giving it my all."], ["Toph", "[Angrily.] You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time!"], ["Azula", "[Sarcastically.] Um, right, I think your friend just said that, genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes. [Rolls her eyes in disgust.]"], ["Toph", "[Angrily.] I'll roll your whole head!"], ["Sokka", "She's just baiting you again."], ["Aang", "Okay, so what do we do, just ignore her?"], ["Sokka", "We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow."], ["Azula", "[Coolly.] It's a trap. Don't say I didn't warn you."], ["Sokka", "[Waves hand up in gesture.] Ignore!"], ["Azula", "[Craftily.] So, Sokka's your name, right? My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time. [Sokka stops walking and casts Azula a suspicious glance.] She was convinced you were going to come rescue her. Of course you never came, and she gave up on you."], ["Azula", "[Evilly to herself.] Come and get it."], ["Sokka", "Where. Is. Suki?!"], ["Zuko", "After I leave here today, I'm gonna free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm gonna beg for his forgiveness. [Cuts to shot of Ozai.] He's the one who's been a real father to me."], ["Ozai", "[Laughs.] Oh, that's just beautiful. And maybe he can pass down to you the ways of tea and failure."], ["Zuko", "But I've come to an even more important decision. [Closes eyes and momentarily pauses.] I'm going to join the Avatar and I'm going to help him defeat you."], ["Ozai", "[Smugly.] Really? Since you're a full-blown traitor now and you want me gone, why wait? I'm powerless. You've got your swords. Why don't you just do it now?"], ["Zuko", "Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny. [Puts his swords away.] Goodbye."], ["Ozai", "[Camera focuses on Zuko walking away, the Fire Lord in the background, now on his feet.] Coward! You think you're brave enough to face me, but you'll only do it during the eclipse. If you have any real courage, you'll stick around until the sun comes out. Don't you want to know what happened to your mother?"], ["Zuko", "What happened that night?"], ["Ozai", "My father, Fire Lord Azulon, had commanded me to do the unthinkable to you, my own son, and I was going to do it. [Cuts to side-view of Zuko.] Your mother found out and swore she would protect you at any cost. [Camera focuses on Ozai.] She knew I wanted the throne and she proposed a plan, a plan in which I would become Fire Lord and your life would be spared."], ["Sokka", "Where's Suki? Answer me!"], ["Aang", "[Grabs Sokka's shoulder as camera pans slightly to the right.] Sokka, she won't talk."], ["Sokka", "[Ignores him.] Where are you keeping her?"], ["Ozai", "Your mother did vicious, treasonous things that night. She knew the consequences and accepted them. For her treason, she was banished."], ["Zuko", "[Grows teary-eyed.] So she's alive?"], ["Ozai", "[Calmly.] Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too merciful a penalty for treason. [Ozai closes his eyes. Shot fades to outside where the solar eclipse begins to end.] Your penalty will be far steeper."], ["Azula", "Oh, sounds like the firebending's back on."], ["Azula", "[Rises and smirks.] Dad's all the way at the end of the hall then down a secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to see you now."], ["Sokka", "[Ashamed.] I fell for it! I used up all our time."], ["Toph", "It's not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us. She had every move planned out."], ["Sokka", "[Sorrowfully.] And now it's too late."], ["Aang", "Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over. But I can face the Fire Lord anyway."], ["Sokka", "[Matter-of-factly.] No. I don't think that's a good idea."], ["Aang", "But I'm ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me."], ["Toph", "The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't. It just wasn't our day. What we need to do now is go and help our friends."], ["Aang", "[Disappointed.] I guess you guys are right."], ["Sokka", "[Placing a hand on Aang's shoulder.] You'll have another chance. I know you will."], ["Bato", "What should we do, Hakoda? Shouldn't something have happened by now?"], ["Hakoda", "I don't know. [Katara crosses her arms in scorn.] But now that the eclipse is over, I expect we're going to see some firebenders any minute."], ["Mechanist", "[Off-camera.] My own invention.

He busted himself out. I've never seen anything like it, he was like a one-man army!"], ["Sokka", "Try and find cover! I think we're about to see some bombs!"], ["Katara", "Why aren't they turning around to attack us again?"], ["Aang", "[Thoughtfully.] They're heading for the beach ... [Alarmed.] They're gonna destroy the submarines!"], ["Sokka", "[Hopelessly.] How are we all going to escape?"], ["Hakoda", "[Approaching, helped by Bato.] We're not."], ["Sokka", "[Looks determined.] Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the Avatar, we could still win."], ["Hakoda", "Yes, with the Avatar we could still win. On another day. You kids have to leave. You have to escape on Appa together."], ["Katara", "[Surprised.] What? [Grabs Hakoda.] We can't leave you behind! [Looks at the rest of the invasion force.] We won't leave anyone behind!"], ["Hakoda", "You're our only chance in the long run. You and Sokka have to go with Aang somewhere safe.

So, what's the new plan?"], ["Sokka", "Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan! You just need to master all four elements and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes."], ["Aang", "[Sarcastically.] Oh, yeah. That's great, no problem. I'll just do that."], ["Katara", "Aang, no one said it's going to be easy."], ["Aang", "Well, it's not even gonna be possible! Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?"], ["Katara", "We could look for Jeong Jeong!"], ["Aang", "[Shooting her idea down.] Yeah ... right.

[Raises an arm in greeting.] Zuko here, but I guess [Rubs his hand against the back of his head nervously.] you probably already know me, sort of. Uhhh ... so, the thing is I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm [Places an arm on his chest with pride.] considered to be pretty good at it. [He continues smiling.] Well, you've seen it, you know, when I was attacking you. [His eyes widen.] Uhhh ... yeah, I guess [Places his fingers against his forehead in embarrassment.] I should apologize for that. But anyway, [Waves an arm to the side dismissively.] I'm good now. [Clenches both fists and places one on his chest while the other arm is raised.] I mean, I thought I was good before, but I realize I was bad, [He gets visibly uncomfortable and drops his arms into a slouch.] but anyway, I think it's time I joined your group and taught [Straightens up with a sincere expression on his face.] the Avatar firebending. [A badgerfrog croaks at him. Angrily.] Well, what's your answer? [The badgerfrog hops on his head before hopping away.] Yeah ... that's what I'd say, too. How am I supposed to convince these people that I'm on their side? What would Uncle do? [Imitating Iroh.] Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self, reveal itself. [Normal voice.] Even when I'm talking for him I can't figure out what he means. What would Azula do? [Imitating Azula.] Listen, Avatar, I can join your group, or I can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends. Your choice. [Normal voice.

Well, uhhh ... anyway ... what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I, uhhh, I'm good now, and well I think I should join your group, oh, and I can teach firebending to you.

I'm not buying it."], ["Zuko", "I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes in the past."], ["Sokka", "Like when you attacked our village?"], ["Katara", "Or when you stole my mother's necklace and used it to track us down and capture us?"], ["Zuko", "Look, I admit I've some awful things. I was wrong to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe. And I never should have sent that Fire Nation assassin after you.

I didn't mean to insult your friend!"], ["Zuko", "[Angrily.] He's not my friend!"], ["Toph", "That guy locked me and Katara in jail and tried to blow us all up!"], ["Zuko", "[To Aang.] Why aren't you saying anything? You once said you thought we could be friends. You know I have good in me."], ["Aang", "There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done.

Now."], ["Zuko", "I'm trying to explain that I'm not that person anymore!"], ["Sokka", "Either you leave, or we attack."], ["Zuko", "If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner.

And if we ever see you again, well, we'd better not see you again!"], ["Zuko", "Uggh! I can't believe how stupid I am! I mean, what was I thinking? Telling them I sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula did that? They would have believed that! Stupid! [A badgerfrog croaks at him.] Uggh!"], ["Katara", "Why would he try to fool us like that?"], ["Sokka", "Obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap."], ["Katara", "This is just like when we were in prison together at Ba Sing Se. He starts talking about his mother and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings."], ["Sokka", "He wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down, then he strikes."], ["Katara", "The thing is, it worked. I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt, but obviously, when the time came, he made his choice, and we paid the price. We can't trust him."], ["Aang", "I kind of have a confession to make. Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao?"], ["Sokka", "And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget? I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!"], ["Katara", "Sokka, I looked at it, and I told you, there was nothing there!"], ["Sokka", "I could feel it! It's my throatal flap!"], ["Aang", "Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko who came in and got me out. He risked his life to save me."], ["Katara", "No way! I'm sure he only did it so he could capture you himself!"], ["Sokka", "Yeah, face it Aang, you're nothing but a big prize to him."], ["Aang", "You're probably right."], ["Katara", "And what was all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free? What a liar!"], ["Toph", "Actually, he wasn't lying."], ["Sokka", "[Sarcastically.] Oh, hooray! In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't add animal cruelty to the list."], ["Toph", "I'm just saying that, considering his messed-up family and how he was raised, he could have turned out a lot worse."], ["Katara", "[Sarcastically.] You're right, Toph! Let's go find him and give him a medal. The \"not as much of a jerk as you could have been\" award!"], ["Toph", "All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere.

I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again."], ["The Duke", "We can go check for her!"], ["Teo", "[Has a bandage around his forehead.] Yeah!

[Everyone is shocked.]"], ["Aang", "You what?"], ["Katara", "Zuko?"], ["Sokka", "Uhhh ...!"], ["Toph", "I thought he could be helpful to us. [Katara begins to try and heal her feet.] And if I talked to him, maybe we could work something out."], ["Sokka", "So he attacked you?"], ["Toph", "Well, he did, and he didn't. It was sort of an accident."], ["Aang", "But he did firebend at you?"], ["Toph", "[Sighs.] Yes."], ["Sokka", "See? You trusted Zuko, and you got burned. Literally!"], ["Katara", "It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better.

We're gonna have to go after him."], ["Aang", "I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right. After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice."], ["Sokka", "He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him."], ["Toph", "Maybe just invite him back here. [Aang and Sokka go to pick her up.] He's already offered himself up as a prisoner once."], ["Sokka", "Yeah, get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner, then we'll jump him and really make him our prisoner.

What are you planning?"], ["Sokka", "Nothing. [Pauses for a moment.] Boy, you're so paranoid."], ["Zuko", "It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here."], ["Sokka", "Thanks, Zuko. [Yawns.] Just knowing makes me feel better."], ["Zuko", "[Sarcastically.] Yeah, I'm sure it does."], ["Sokka", "[To Appa.] Shhh."], ["Zuko", "Not up to anything, huh?"], ["Sokka", "[Falls off Appa, his bag's contents fall out.] Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my dad. You happy now?"], ["Zuko", "I'm never happy."], ["Sokka", "[Picking up the fallen items.] Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan was my idea, it was my decision to stay when things were going wrong. [Zuko jumps off of Appa.] It's my mistake, and it's my job to fix it. I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me, Zuko. [Pushes Zuko aside and begins to climb up Appa on Appa's saddle.]"], ["Zuko", "You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you."], ["Sokka", "No. I have to do this alone."], ["Zuko", "How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked, prisons don't have bison daycares. [Sokka stops climbing, sighs, and looks back at Zuko.] We'll take my war balloon. [They walk off to the war balloon.]"], ["Toph", "What does it say?"], ["Katara", "\"Need meat. Gone fishing. Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko.\" [As she says this, Aang yawns and turns around to lie back down.] One more thing. \"Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badgerfrog croak. Zuko.\""], ["Aang", "[Sighs.] Nobody else has homework. [Stands up and walks to a spot and starts hot squatting while Katara and Toph walk away.] One hot squat, two hot squat, three hot squat, four hot squat ..."], ["Sokka", "Pretty clouds."], ["Zuko", "Yeah ... fluffy. [Sokka whistles.] What?"], ["Sokka", "What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons."], ["Zuko", "No kidding."], ["Sokka", "Yep, a balloon ... but for war."], ["Zuko", "If there's one thing my dad's good at, it's war. [Blasts more fire into the tank.]"], ["Sokka", "Yeah, it seems to run in the family."], ["Zuko", "[Looks at Sokka, defensively.] Hey, hold on. Not everyone in my family is like that."], ["Sokka", "I know, I know, you've changed."], ["Zuko", "[Downcast.] I meant my uncle. He was more of a father to me. And I really let him down."], ["Sokka", "I think your uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us? That's hard."], ["Zuko", "It wasn't that hard."], ["Sokka", "Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?"], ["Zuko", "Well, I did have a girlfriend. Mai."], ["Sokka", "[Smiles and looks at Zuko with interest.] That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?"], ["Zuko", "[Smiles.] Yeah. Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor. I couldn't drag her into it."], ["Sokka", "My first girlfriend turned into the moon."], ["Zuko", "[Shocked for a moment. Looks up at the sky briefly, before glancing back at Sokka.] That's rough, buddy."], ["Zuko", "There it is! [Sokka awakens to see it.] There's plenty of steam to keep us covered. As long as we're quiet, we should be able to navigate through it without being caught."], ["Zuko", "[Frantically blasting fire into the tank.] We're going down! The balloon's not working anymore! [Blasts fire up into the balloon.]"], ["Sokka", "The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly!"], ["Zuko", "[Falls to the side as the balloon tips.] So what are we supposed to do?"], ["Sokka", "I don't know! Crash-landing?"], ["Zuko", "[Looking at the destroyed war balloon.] How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work?"], ["Sokka", "We'll figure something out! I suspected it might be a one-way ticket."], ["Zuko", "You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?"], ["Sokka", "[Walks to the destroyed balloon.] My dad might be here! I had to come and see!"], ["Zuko", "Uncle always said I never thought things through. But this ... this is just crazy!"], ["Sokka", "[Gathers parts from the balloon together.] Hey, I never wanted you to come along in the first place! And for the record, I always think things through! But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time, I'm playing it by ear. So there. [After the hot water on the balloon burns his hand, Sokka kicks it into the water.]"], ["Zuko", "What are you doing?"], ["Sokka", "It doesn't work anyway, and we don't want anyone to find it."], ["Zuko", "I hope you know what you're doing. [They both turn to look at the prison.] There's no turning back now."], ["Zuko", "I hope these disguises work."], ["Sokka", "We just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible."], ["Male guard", "Guards! There's a scuffle in the yard. Come on."], ["Chit Sang", "I didn't do anything! I'm going back to my cell."], ["Bully guard", "[Whips fire at him.] Stop right there, Chit Sang."], ["Sokka", "We can't blow our cover."], ["Bully guard", "I've had it with your unruly behavior!"], ["Chit Sang", "What did I do?"], ["Bully guard", "He wants to know what he did. [To Zuko and Sokka.] Isn't that cute? [Gives them a look when they say nothing.]"], ["Zuko", "Uh, very cute, sir."], ["Sokka", "Super cute."], ["Bully guard", "[Walks up to Chit Sang.] You didn't bow down when I walked by, Chit Sang!"], ["Chit Sang", "What? That's not a prison rule."], ["Bully guard", "Do it!"], ["Chit Sang", "Make me."], ["Bully guard", "Tsk, tsk. Firebending is prohibited. You're going in the cooler. [Pointing at Sokka.] You! Help me take him in."], ["Sokka", "[Whispers to Zuko.] Meet back here in an hour. [Runs up to Chit Sang and the guard.]"], ["Bully guard", "The warden will deal with you soon. [Sokka closes the doors.] Can you believe this guy?"], ["Sokka", "[Playing along.] Prisoners! Am I right?"], ["Bully guard", "Ugh. Tell me about it."], ["Male guard", "Hey, new guy! I know it's the rule to have your helmet on at all times, but this is the lounge. Relax."], ["Zuko", "But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared, someone could strike me on the head."], ["Female guard", "Give it a week, he'll loosen up."], ["Zuko", "Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison?"], ["Female guard", "[Bluntly.] No, you can't date the female guards."], ["Male guard", "Trust me, you don't want to. [The female guard throws a cup at him, which causes the guard sitting behind him to laugh.]"], ["Zuko", "No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals, right? [The other guards nod.] So what about war prisoners?"], ["Sokka", "It sure looks cold in there."], ["Bully guard", "That's why we call it the cooler. He won't be firebending there. [Notices someone coming; lowers his mask.] It's the warden! [He and Sokka stand to attention.] Look alive!"], ["Warden", "[Opens the cooler.] So Chit Sang, I hear you used firebending to try to escape. You should know better."], ["Chit Sang", "I wasn't trying to escape."], ["Bully guard", "He's lying! I saw it with my own eyes. [He is pushed aside by one of the warden's bodyguards.]"], ["Warden", "No one has ever, ever escaped from here. I'd sooner jump in the Boiling Lake myself than let that record fall. Don't forget it. Now go back to your shivering."], ["Zuko", "Hey there, fellow guard, how goes it?"], ["Sokka", "[Lifts up his helmet's visor.] Zuko?"], ["Zuko", "Shhh! Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no Water Tribe prisoners. [Lifts up his visor.] I'm afraid your father's not here."], ["Sokka", "What? Are you sure, did you double-check?"], ["Zuko", "Yeah, I'm sure."], ["Sokka", "No. No! [Bangs his fists against the wall in frustration.]"], ["Zuko", "I'm really sorry, Sokka."], ["Sokka", "So we came all this way for nothing? I failed ... again."], ["Zuko", "Ah, [Holds his chin in thought.] what would Uncle say? [Cut to a frog-view as he looks up at the sky.] Sometimes, clouds have two sides, [Walks over to the railing.] a dark and light, and a silver lining in between. It's like a silver sandwich! [Close-up of a disinterested Sokka; voice-over.] So ... when life seems hard ... [Sokka glances to the side.] take a bite out of the silver sandwich!"], ["Sokka", "Maybe we haven't failed after all!"], ["Zuko", "That's the spirit! [Folds his arms.] I can't believe that worked. [Looks down.] I didn't even know what I was saying."], ["Sokka", "No, what you said made no sense at all. But look ... [As he points, the camera shifts to an overhead view of the yard, before rapidly zooming in on a dejected-looking Suki.] It's Suki!"], ["Guard", "[Voice-over.] Prisoners, [Suki gets up.] back in your cells!"], ["Suki", "[Sits up; aggressively.] What is it? Did I do something wrong?"], ["Sokka", "[Crosses arms.] You mean you don't recognize me?"], ["Suki", "[Close-up. She averts her eyes; bitterly.] You people all look the same to me."], ["Sokka", "[Frontal shot; smugly.] Oh? Then maybe you'll recognize this."], ["Suki", "Sokka! [Runs up to him; cut to a side-view.] It's you!"], ["Sokka", "[They both stand up, not releasing each other.] The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here?"], ["Suki", "No. I don't know where they are. They locked me in here because I'm the leader."], ["Sokka", "[Places his right hand on her left cheek.] Well, you won't be here for long. I'm busting you out."], ["Suki", "[Frontal shot.] I'm so glad [Places her hand over Sokka's on her face and closes her eyes.] to see you Sokka. [Opens them again.] I knew you'd come."], ["Female guard", "Excuse me. [Cut to a shot from behind Zuko.] I need to get into that cell."], ["Zuko", "[Shot from over the guard's shoulder.] No, you can't go in there! [Looks at the prison cell; unsure.] The lights are out. [Points at the door.] The prisoner could sneak up on you."], ["Female guard", "[Close-up. Cut to a side-shot; annoyed.] Step aside, fool. [She raises her left arm to push Zuko out of the way, though before she can touch him, he grabs hold of the arm and turns her around, slamming her face first against the door.] Hey, hey, what are you doing?"], ["Female guard", "[Instantly cut to a frontal shot of Sokka, who freezes over.] Guard, help! [He turns to look at the struggle.] I think he's an impostor! [Frontal shot of Sokka, looking unsure.] Arrest him!"], ["Female guard", "Get him off me and arrest him!"], ["Sokka", "[Grabs Zuko and throws him down on the floor.] You're under arrest! [Whispering.] Don't worry, I'll figure it out."], ["Warden", "Well, well, well. I never thought I'd find you in here, [Smiles evilly and walks into the cell.] Prince Zuko."], ["Zuko", "[Shocked.] How did you know who I am?"], ["Warden", "How could I not? You broke my niece's heart."], ["Zuko", "[Even more shocked.] You're Mai's uncle? I never meant to hurt her."], ["Warden", "Quiet! You're my special prisoner now. And you'd best behave. If these criminals found out who you are, the traitor prince who let his nation down, why they'd tear you to shreds."], ["Zuko", "[Folds his arms.] So what's in it for you? Why don't you just tell my father to come collect a reward?"], ["Warden", "Oh, in due time, believe me, I intend to collect. [Walks away and shuts the door.]"], ["Sokka", "Oh, good, you guys have met."], ["Suki", "Actually, we met a long time ago."], ["Zuko", "We did?"], ["Suki", "[Somewhat angrily.] Yeah, you kind of burned down my village."], ["Zuko", "[Stops mopping for a second.] Oh, sorry about that. Nice to see you again."], ["Sokka", "So, listen, I think I have an escape plan. I checked out the coolers again, and the point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?"], ["Zuko", "Yeah ..."], ["Sokka", "So, they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well, to keep the cold in, it also has to keep the heat out, right?"], ["Suki", "Just get to the point, Sokka."], ["Sokka", "It's a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water."], ["Zuko", "[Exchanges a worried glance with Suki.] The cooler as a boat? Are you sure?"], ["Sokka", "I'm telling you, it'll work. [Flashes back to Sokka walking around the island; voice-over.] I walked around the perimeter. There's a blind spot between two guard towers. It's the perfect launching point. [Sokka puts a miniature boat in the water and watching it float away.] I already tested it out. We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current. It'll take us straight across. As long as we don't make a sound, no one will notice. [Fade back to Sokka talking to Zuko and Suki.] And bing-bang-boom, we're home free."], ["Suki", "But how are you going to get the cooler out?"], ["Chit Sang", "[From the staircase.] Yeah, how are you going to get the cooler out? [Jumps down.]"], ["Sokka", "[Covering up.] What? We didn't ... w-we didn't say that."], ["Zuko", "Yeah, you heard wrong."], ["Chit Sang", "I heard you hatching an escape plan, and I want in."], ["Zuko", "There's nothing to get in on."], ["Sokka", "Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is ... an egg?"], ["Chit Sang", "[Unconvinced.] Okay, well, I come with you or the warden [Camera pans from a serious-looking Zuko to Suki.] hears about this egg, too."], ["Suki", "[To Sokka.] I guess we have no choice."], ["Sokka", "Okay, you're in. [Handing Zuko a wrench.] Now first we need someone to unbolt the cooler, from the inside."], ["Chit Sang", "Oh, I can get you inside."], ["Chit Sang", "Hey! What are you, stupid? Watch where you're going! [Shoves Zuko.]"], ["Zuko", "Hey, you watch who you're shoving! [He pushes Chit Sang.]"], ["Chit Sang", "I think you mean whom I'm shoving!"], ["Sokka", "[Approaching. Yelling.] I need backup over here!"], ["Male guard", "No firebending! [Pointing.] Into the cooler!"], ["Sokka", "I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson."], ["Zuko", "[Raises his head slightly and releases a small breath of fire to warm himself up.] Yes, I have ... completely. [Reveals all the removed bolts and screws, which makes Sokka smile.]"], ["Sokka", "[Lifts his visor; whispering.] I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore."], ["Zuko", "Someone's coming! [Takes Sokka into the cooler and closes the door.]"], ["Male guard", "Yeah, new arrivals coming in at dawn."], ["Female guard", "Anybody interesting?"], ["Male guard", "Nah, just the usual. Some robbers, a couple traitors, some war prisoners, [Sokka looks at Zuko with shock and worry.] though I did hear there might be a pirate."], ["Female guard", "No fooling!"], ["Zuko", "War prisoners. It could be your father."], ["Sokka", "I know."], ["Zuko", "Well, what should we do? Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?"], ["Sokka", "I don't know! Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up?"], ["Zuko", "It's your call, Sokka."], ["Chit Sang", "Took you guys long enough. [Cut briefly to two other prisoners, a male sitting on a rock, and a female waving.] This here's my girl and my best buddy, they're coming too."], ["Sokka", "Fine. Everybody in the cooler. Let's go. [They move the cooler into the water. Cut to Sokka lifting a rock hiding his Water Tribe outfit.]"], ["Zuko", "Are you sure you wanna go? You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself. Redeem your honor. Rescuing your dad is your chance."], ["Suki", "[Approaching.] Your dad?"], ["Sokka", "[Turns to Zuko.] If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail."], ["Zuko", "No, it's not. Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out."], ["Sokka", "[Standing.] That supposed to make me feel better?"], ["Zuko", "[Sokka moves away.] Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again ..."], ["Sokka", "Seriously, not helping."], ["Zuko", "[Grabs Sokka's shoulder.] You have to try every time. You can't quit because you're afraid you might fail."], ["Chit Sang", "[Standing by the cooler boat.] Hey, if you two are done cuddling, can we get a move on?"], ["Sokka", "No. I'm staying. You guys go. [To Suki.] You've been here long enough."], ["Suki", "I'm not leaving without you, Sokka."], ["Zuko", "I'm staying, too."], ["Chit Sang", "Not me, I'm out. Let's roll, baby. [Pushes the cooler into the lake and jumps in.]"], ["Sokka", "We gave up our only chance of escaping. I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake."], ["Chit Sang", "Aah, this current is so slow. I can use this to paddle. [Rips off a piece of the cooler. When he puts the piece of metal in the water, the steaming water splashes on to his hand, causing him to scream loudly.]"], ["Warden", "Guards! Secure the perimeter and lock down the prisoners!

Hi-yah!"], ["Actress Katara", "Who are you, frozen boy?"], ["Actress Aang", "[Laughs; in a high-pitched voice.] I'm the Avatar, silly, here to spread joy and fun! [She leans toward Actress Katara, laying a finger on her lips, and also motions toward Actor Sokka before standing upright and spreading her arms out in a cheery gesture.]"], ["Aang", "Wait, is that a woman playing me?"], ["Actress Katara", "[Gasps.] An airbender! [Clasps her hands to her chest.] My heart is so full of hope, [Drops down on one knee emotionally.] that it's making me tearbend! [Begins to cry and grabs on to Actress Aang's leg. Cut to close-up of Actress Katara who continues to bawl dramatically. Cut back to shot of the entire trio.]"], ["Actor Sokka", "My stomach is so empty, that it's making me tearbend! [Throws his arms up hopelessly before dropping to his knees, clutching on to Actress Aang's other leg, and crying.] I need meat! [Cut to close-up of Actor Sokka.]"], ["Actress Aang", "[Stoops down, puts her arm around Actor Sokka's shoulders, and points upward.] But wait! Is that a platter of meaty dumplings? [Cut to actual Aang whose head and arm rest lazily on the railing, unimpressed.]"], ["Actor Sokka", "[Excitedly; shielding his eyes with his hand and turning his head, searching for the alleged dumplings.] Ooh, where, where?"], ["Actress Aang", "[Laughs and swings arm jovially.] Did I mention that I'm an incurable prankster? [Crosses her legs as the audience laughs.]"], ["Aang", "[Cut to wide shot of Team Avatar. Aang extends his arm toward the stage, angry with the actress' bad portrayal.] I don't do that! That's not what I'm like! And I'm not a woman! [Throws hands up in frustration.]"], ["Toph", "[Laughs and turns to face Aang.] Oh, they nailed you, Twinkle Toes! [Continues to laugh.]"], ["Actor Iroh", "Prince Zuko, you must try this cake! [Holds up a platter of cake with one slice missing.]"], ["Actor Zuko", "I don't have time to stuff my face! [Lowers his telescope and turns to Actor Iroh.] I must capture the Avatar to regain my honor! [Faces out into the audience, clutching his hand in a fist assertively.]"], ["Actor Iroh", "[Cut to wide shot of the model ship.] Well, while you do that, maybe I'll capture another slice. [He holds the cake up higher before bringing it toward his face and proceeding to gobble it down ravenously and noisily.]"], ["Actor Zuko", "[Viewing Actor Iroh.] You sicken me!"], ["Zuko", "[Gestures toward the stage.] They make me look totally stiff and humorless."], ["Katara", "[Complacently amused.] Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on."], ["Zuko", "[In protest; holding his arms out.] How could you say that?"], ["Actor Iroh", "[Completely at ease.] Let's forget about the Avatar and get massages!"], ["Actor Zuko", "[Turns toward his uncle, leaning forward menacingly; shouting.] How could you say that?"], ["Actress Aang", "Hey look, I think I found something!

Jet will wipe out that nasty town for you!"], ["Actress Katara", "Oh Jet, you're so bad."], ["Actress Aang", "[Gasps.] Look! It's the Great Divide!

[Exits on the moon prop.] And yes, I did have pickled fish!"], ["Suki", "[Laughs.] You never told me you made out with a Moon Spirit."], ["Sokka", "Shhh! [Tearing up.] I'm trying to watch!

That woman playing the Avatar doesn't resemble me at all!"], ["Toph", "I don't know, you are more in touch with your feminine side than most guys."], ["Aang", "[Standing up.] Argh!"], ["Katara", "Relax, Aang. They're not accurate portrayals. It's not like I'm a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time. [Everyone looks at her.] What?"], ["Aang", "[Turns around and sits down. Sarcastically.] Yeah, that's not you at all."], ["Toph", "Listen friends, it's obvious that the playwright did his research. I know it must hurt, but what you're seeing up there on that stage is the truth."], ["Actress Katara", "Well, here we are in the Earth Kingdom!"], ["Actress Aang", "[Opens up her miniature air glider prop.] I'd better have a look around to see if I can find an earthbending teacher!

It hurts, doesn't it?"], ["Toph", "Are you kidding me? I wouldn't have cast it any other way! [Laughs as Katara looks away in dismay.] At least it's not a flying bald lady!

[Waves hand in front of Actor Toph's eyes.]"], ["Actor Toph", "[Laughs.] I can see you doing that. I see everything that you see, except I don't \"see\" like you do. I release a sonic wave from my mouth. [Screams very loudly at the Team Avatar players. The audience and Team Avatar grimace at the scream; Aang claps his hands over his ears, Zuko grips the railing in front of him, Suki and Sokka hug each other in terror, and Katara grits her teeth while Toph looks excited.] There. I got a pretty good look at you. [Actress Aang and the audience claps.]"], ["Actor Iroh", "Zuko, it's time we had a talk ...

Continue drilling! The city of Ba Sing Se can hide no longer!"], ["Actress Aang", "No, Jet! What did they do to you?"], ["Actor Jet", "Must ... serve ... Earth King!

[Stands up and walks toward Actor Zuko.] Why, he's like a little brother to me! [Laughs.] I certainly don't think of him in a romantic way.

Aang gets up.]"], ["Sokka", "[Whispering.] Oh, you're getting up? [As Aang leaves.] Can you get me some fire flakes? [Puts his arm around Suki, but whispers to Aang again.] Ooh, and fire gummies! [Puts his arm back around Suki, who looks slightly annoyed.]"], ["Actress Azula", "Well, my brother, what's it going to be? Your nation, or a life of treachery?"], ["Actor Iroh", "[Stops drinking from a cup.] Choose treachery, it's more fun!

I mean, you guys lose a lot!"], ["Sokka", "You're one to talk, Suki. Didn't Azula take you captive? That's right, she did!"], ["Suki", "[Looks at Sokka seriously.] Are you trying to get on my bad side?"], ["Sokka", "I'm just saying ..."], ["Katara", "Does anyone know where Aang is?"], ["Sokka", "He left to get me fire gummies, like, ten minutes ago. And I'm still waiting!"], ["Katara", "I'm gonna check outside."], ["Katara", "Are you all right?"], ["Aang", "[Angered.] No, I'm not! I hate this play! [Yanks his hat off and throws it on the ground.]"], ["Katara", "I know it's upsetting, but it sounds like you're overreacting."], ["Aang", "Overreacting? If I hadn't blocked my chakra, I'd probably be in the Avatar State right now!"], ["Sokka", "Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage? I got some jokes I want to give to the actor me."], ["Suki", "[Seriously.] I'm an elite warrior who's trained for many years in the art of stealth. [Smiling.] I think I could get you backstage! [Sokka and Suki leave.]"], ["Toph", "[To Zuko, after observing everyone's reactions.] Geez, everyone's getting so upset about their characters. Even you seem more down than usual, and that's saying something!"], ["Zuko", "You don't get it, it's different for you. You get a muscly version of yourself, taking down ten bad guys at once, and making sassy remarks."], ["Toph", "Yeah, that's pretty great!"], ["Zuko", "But for me, it takes all the mistakes I've made in my life, and shoves them back in my face. My uncle, he's always been on my side, even when things were bad. He was there for me, he taught me so much, and how do I repay him? With a knife in his back. It's my greatest regret, and I may never get to redeem myself."], ["Toph", "[Sits down next to him.] You have redeemed yourself to your uncle. You don't realize it, but you already have."], ["Zuko", "How do you know?"], ["Toph", "Because I once had a long conversation with the guy, and all he would talk about was you."], ["Zuko", "Really?"], ["Toph", "Yeah, and it was kind of annoying."], ["Zuko", "Oh, sorry."], ["Toph", "But it was also very sweet. All your uncle wanted was for you to find your own path, and see the light. Now you're here with us. He'd be proud. [Punches Zuko on the shoulder.]"], ["Zuko", "Ow! What was that for?"], ["Toph", "That's how I show affection."], ["Young boy", "Your Zuko costume's pretty good, but your scar's on the wrong side.

I'm a big Sokka fan, but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be."], ["Actor Sokka", "[Starts walking away.] Aww no, another fan with ideas."], ["Sokka", "[Runs in front of him.] Just hear me out. [Pulls out some cards.] Here's something I think the real Sokka would say. [Clears throat.] What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages? A cabbage patch!"], ["Actor Sokka", "[Chuckles.] That's actually pretty good! Let me see those! [Takes the cards from Sokka. Reads one and laughs.] \"A rocky relationship\" ... not bad!"], ["Sokka", "[Puts his arm around Actor Sokka's shoulder.] Also, don't be afraid to make up some phrases, especially before an attack. Something like ... \"Flying kick-a-pow!\". [The two begin to walk away.]"], ["Actor Sokka", "Who are you, anyway?"], ["Sokka", "I'm just a guy who likes comedy."], ["Aang", "Katara, did you really mean what you said in there?"], ["Katara", "In where? What are you talking about?"], ["Aang", "On stage, when you said I was just like a ... brother to you, and you didn't have feelings for me."], ["Katara", "I didn't say that. An actor said that."], ["Aang", "But it's true, isn't it? We kissed at the Invasion, and I thought we were gonna be together. But we're not."], ["Katara", "Aang, I don't know."], ["Aang", "Why don't you know?"], ["Katara", "Because, we're in the middle of a war, and, we have other things to worry about. This isn't the right time."], ["Aang", "Well, when is the right time?"], ["Katara", "Aang, I'm sorry, but right now I'm just a little confused."], ["Katara", "I just said I was confused! I'm going inside. [Exits the balcony.]"], ["Aang", "Ugh, I'm such an idiot! [Puts down his head on the balcony railing.]"], ["Sokka", "Here's what you missed ... we went to the Fire Nation, and you got better, and Katara was the Painted Lady, and I got a sword, and I think Combustion Man died. Oh, look, the Invasion's about to start! Shhh!"], ["Actress Katara", "I just wanted to let you know, Aang, that I'll always love you. Like a brother."], ["Actress Aang", "[Punching the air.] I wouldn't want it any other way!"], ["Actor Sokka", "Hey Toph, would you say you and Aang have a \"rocky relationship\"?

Come on! [All exit stage left, except for Actress Aang, who is lifted off stage.]"], ["Sokka", "[Stands up and stretches.] I guess that's it.

However, earthbender rebellions have prevented us from achieving total victory in the Earth Kingdom."], ["Ozai", "What is your recommendation?"], ["Shinu", "Our army is spread too thin, but once the eclipse is over and the invasion defeated, we should transfer more domestic forces into the Earth Kingdom."], ["Ozai", "Hmm. Prince Zuko, you've been among the Earth Kingdom commoners. Do you think that adding more troops will stop these rebellions?"], ["Zuko", "The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong.

My uncle invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders."], ["Aang", "So, have you ever redirected lightning before?"], ["Zuko", "Once, against my father."], ["Aang", "What did it feel like?"], ["Zuko", "[Stops practicing the lightning redirection form.] Exhilarating ...

I didn't feel like myself."], ["Sokka", "[Off-camera.] There, that's how it's done."], ["Katara", "[Holding a scroll.] I have a surprise for everyone!"], ["Toph", "I knew it! You did have a secret thing with Haru! [She smiles while Sokka, Suki, and Zuko look at her strangely.]"], ["Katara", "Uh, no. [Everybody else starts eating again.] I was looking for cooking pots in the attic, and I found this! [Unravels the scroll showing a painting of a happy dark-haired baby playing at the beach.] Look at baby Zuko. Isn't he cute?"], ["Katara", "[To Zuko.] Oh, lighten up. I'm just teasing."], ["Zuko", "That's not me. It's my father."], ["Suki", "But he looks so sweet and innocent."], ["Zuko", "Well, that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster, and the worst father in the history of fathers."], ["Aang", "[The camera pans to him.] But he's still a human being."], ["Zuko", "You're going to defend him?"], ["Aang", "No, I agree with you. [Stands up.] Fire Lord Ozai is a horrible person, and the world would probably be better off without him, but there's got to be another way."], ["Zuko", "Like what?"], ["Aang", "I don't know. [Perking up.] Maybe we can make some big pots of glue, and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore."], ["Zuko", "[Sarcastically.] Yeah, then you can show him his baby pictures, and all those happy memories will make him good again. [Suki and Sokka laugh in the background.]"], ["Aang", "[Excitedly.]\u00a0Do you really think that would work?"], ["Zuko", "[Bluntly.] No!"], ["Aang", "[Sighs. Paces back and forth.] This goes against everything I learned from the monks. I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like."], ["Sokka", "Sure you can. You're the Avatar. If it's in the name of keeping balance, I'm pretty sure the universe will forgive you."], ["Aang", "[Turns back to Sokka; losing his temper.] This isn't a joke, Sokka! None of you understand the position I'm in."], ["Katara", "Aang, we do understand. It's just ..."], ["Aang", "Just what, Katara? What?"], ["Katara", "We're trying to help!"], ["Aang", "Then, when you figure out a way for me to beat the Fire Lord without taking his life, I'd love to hear it! [Walks away.]"], ["Katara", "Aang, don't walk away from this. [Walks toward Aang.]"], ["Zuko", "[Puts a hand on Katara's shoulder to stop her.] Let him go. He needs time to sort it out by himself."], ["Aang", "[Stroking the lemur's head.]\u00a0Hey, Momo. I don't suppose you know what I should do. [Momo squawks.] I didn't think so."], ["Sokka", "Okay, that's everything."], ["Toph", "No, it's not. Where's Aang?"], ["Zuko", "Aang? Aang!"], ["Toph", "Come on, lazy bones, let's go."], ["Sokka", "He left his staff. [Picks up the staff.] That's so strange."], ["Zuko", "[Walks onto the porch with Toph.] Aang's not in the house. Let's check the beach. [Turns his head toward the beach.]"], ["Sokka", "Look, there's his footprints. [The camera pans up toward Aang's footprints, which stop at the beach.] The trail ends here."], ["Suki", "So, he went for a midnight swim and never came back?"], ["Katara", "Maybe he was captured."], ["Sokka", "I don't think so. [Examining the footprints.] There's no sign of a struggle."], ["Toph", "I bet he ran away again."], ["Sokka", "Uh-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa."], ["Toph", "Then what do you think happened to him, oh sleuthy one?"], ["Sokka", "It's pretty obvious. Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey."], ["Zuko", "But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here?"], ["Sokka", "[Downcast.] Oh, yeah. Forgot about that."], ["Katara", "Then he's got to be somewhere on Ember Island. Let's split up and look for him."], ["Toph", "I'm going with Zuko! [Sokka, Suki, and Katara stare at her.] What?!

[Crowd cheers.]"], ["Toph", "And then when I was nine, I ran away again."], ["Zuko", "Uh-huh."], ["Toph", "I know I shouldn't complain. My parents gave me everything I ever asked for, but they never gave me the one thing I really wanted, their love. You know what I mean?"], ["Zuko", "[Sighs and stops walking.] Look, I know you had a really rough childhood, but we should really focus on finding Aang. [Continues walking.]"], ["Toph", "This is the worst field trip ever. [Sighs and continues walking.]"], ["Sokka", "Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang, either.

I knew it was only a matter of time! [Jumps down to Appa.] Appa ate Momo! [Lifts up Appa's mouth.] Momo, I'm coming for you, buddy."], ["Katara", "Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang."], ["Sokka", "That's just what Appa wants you to think. [Climbs into Appa's mouth.]"], ["Zuko", "Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka. We have a real problem here. Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only two days away."], ["Katara", "What should we do Zuko?"], ["Zuko", "[Stands up.] I don't know. [They keep staring.] Why are you all looking at me?"], ["Katara", "Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang."], ["Toph", "Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the Avatar ... it's you."], ["Sokka", "Zuko, I don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there."], ["Zuko", "Just trust me."], ["Azula", "[To her palanquin bearers.] Come on slowpokes! Faster!"], ["Azula", "[Pants.] Sorry I'm late, father. Good palanquin bearers are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything ready for our departure?"], ["Ozai", "[Facing the ship.] There has been a change of plans, Azula."], ["Azula", "[Worried.] What?"], ["Ozai", "I've decided to lead the fleet of airships to Ba Sing Se alone. You will remain here in the Fire Nation."], ["Azula", "But I thought we were going to do this together."], ["Ozai", "My decision is final."], ["Azula", "You ... you can't treat me like this! [Rising.] You can't treat me like Zuko!"], ["Ozai", "Azula, silence yourself."], ["Azula", "But it was my idea to burn everything to the ground! I deserve to be by your side!"], ["Ozai", "Azula! [She bows her head.] Listen to me. I need you here to watch over the homeland. It's a very important job that I can only entrust to you."], ["Azula", "Really?"], ["Ozai", "And for your loyalty, I've decided to declare you the new Fire Lord."], ["Azula", "Fire Lord Azula? It does seem appropriate, but what about you?"], ["Ozai", "Fire Lord Ozai is no more. Just as the world will be reborn in fire, I shall be reborn as the supreme ruler of the world.

Her skin is flawless."], ["Sokka", "No, she has this giant mole creature she rides around on."], ["Zuko", "The shirshu. It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the world.
